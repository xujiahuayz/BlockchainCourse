abstract = {Blockchains represent a novel application of cryptography and information technology to age-old problems of financial record-keeping, and they may lead to far-reaching changes in corporate governance. Many major players in the financial industry have began to invest in this new technology, and stock exchanges have proposed using blockchains as a new method for trading corporate equities and tracking their ownership. This essay evaluates the potential implications of these changes for managers, institutional investors, small shareholders, auditors, and other parties involved in corporate governance. The lower cost, greater liquidity, more accurate record-keeping, and transparency of ownership offered by block-chains may significantly upend the balance of power among these cohorts.},

abstract = {Social graphs derived from online social interactions contain a wealth of information that is nowadays extensively used by both industry and academia. However, due to the sensitivity of information contained in such social graphs, they need to be properly anonymized before release. Most of the graph anonymization techniques that have been proposed to sanitize social graph data rely on the perturbation of the original graph's structure, more specifically of its edge set. In this paper, we identify a fundamental weakness of these edge-based anonymization mechanisms and exploit it to recover most of the original graph structure. First, we propose a method to quantify an edge's plausibility in a given graph by relying on graph embedding. Our experiments on three real-life social network datasets under two widely known graph anonymization mechanisms demonstrate that this method can very effectively detect fake edges with AUC values above 0.95 in most cases. Second, by relying on Gaussian mixture models and maximum a posteriori probability estimation, we derive an optimal decision rule to detect whether an edge is fake based on the observed graph data. We further demonstrate that this approach concretely jeopardizes the privacy guarantees provided by the considered graph anonymization mechanisms. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a method to generate fake edges as plausible as possible given the graph structure and incorporate it into the existing anonymization mechanisms. Our evaluation demonstrates that the enhanced mechanisms not only decrease the chances of graph recovery (with AUC dropping by up to 35%), but also provide even better graph utility than existing anonymization methods.},

abstract = {We investigate numerical valuation of cross-currency interest rate-based derivatives under Babbs' extended Vasicek-style model by n umerical solution of the associated partial diierential equation PDE | in particular, we consider the terminable diierential dii swap. Firstly we precisely formulate, in terms of their cash hows, various types of single and cross-currency swaps and swaptions. We describe Babbs' model for the domestic and foreign term structures and the exchange rate, its formulation in terms of three correlated driftless Gaussian processes and the associated three state variable parabolic PDE. We then formulate enite diierence approximations to the PDE, and discuss explicit and implicit methods. With this discrete approximation to the valuation problem in a period, we proceed to value the terminable dii swap and other deals numerically by backwards recursion through the payment dates, and investigate the solutions found graphically. We conclude that it is certainly practical, on a fast workstation, to solve for the value function of a wide range of cross-currency derivative securities by solution of explicit tnite diierence approximations of the PDE.},

@inproceedings{Perez2020b,
abstract = {Blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, use an approach called "metering" to assign a cost to smart contract execution, an approach which is designed to incentivise miners to operate the network and protect it against DoS attacks. In the past, the imperfections of Ethereum metering allowed several DoS attacks which were countered through modification of the metering mechanism. This paper presents a new DoS attack on Ethereum which systematically exploits its metering mechanism. We first replay and analyse several months of transactions, during which we discover a number of discrepancies in the metering model, such as significant inconsistencies in the pricing of the instructions. We further demonstrate that there is very little correlation between the execution cost and the utilised resources, such as CPU and memory. Based on these observations, we present a new type of DoS attack we call Resource Exhaustion Attack, which uses these imperfections to generate low-throughput contracts. To do this, we design a genetic algorithm that generates contracts with a throughput on average 100 times slower than typical contracts. We then show that all major Ethereum client implementations are vulnerable and, if running on commodity hardware, would be unable to stay in sync with the network when under attack. We argue that such an attack could be financially attractive not only for Ethereum competitors and speculators, but also for Ethereum miners. Finally, we discuss short-term and potential long-term fixes against such attacks. Our attack has been responsibly disclosed to the Ethereum Foundation and awarded a bug bounty reward of 5,000 USD.},

We document substantial return predictability from the set of easy-to-analyze firms to their more complicated peers. Specifically, a simple portfolio strategy that takes advantage of this straightforward vs. complicated information processing classification yields returns of 118 basis points per month before transaction costs. Consistent with processing complexity driving the return relation, we further show that the more complicated the firm, the more pronounced the return predictability. In addition, we find that sell-side analysts are subject to these same information processing constraints, as their forecast revisions of easy-to-analyze firms predict their future revisions of more complicated firms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

Overcoming these limita-tions is critical for improving both functional properties of blockchains, such as confidentiality and consistency, as well as their non-functional properties, such as performance and scalability.

In the darkweb environment, many illegal trades, such as in drugs or child pornography, avoid their transactions being traced by exploiting mixing services. Therefore, de-mixing algorithms are needed to identify illegal financial flows and to reduce criminal activities. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of real-world mixing services, and propose a de-mixing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can effectively find relationships among the input addresses and corresponding output ones of mixing services by exploiting the static and dynamic parameters of mixing services.},

abstract = {Research proposing the application of blockchain technology in accounting assumes the utilization of decentralized consensus mechanisms based on the exertion of scarce resources (Proof-of-Work; PoW), leading to the validation of transactions without the need of any third party. Together with the blockchain, a shared database, PoW is expected to lead to nearly immutable and, therefore, fraud-resistant, real-time financial registers. This conclusion must be reconsidered, taking into account recurrent top-management involvement in accounting scandals, often conducted through deliberate exposures of internal and external control systems. This paper asserts that blockchain-based accounting using PoW-based consensus paves the way for the suspension of controls by the management, since exerting the majority of computer power is easier than circumventing internal and external control systems in conventional accounting systems. Alternatives to PoW must be considered for blockchain-based accounting that prevents the management from conducting fraud and, thereby, qualifies the blockchain for its application in accounting.

abstract = {Smart contracts are computer programs that can be consistently executed by a network of mutually distrusting nodes, without the arbitration of a trusted authority. Because of their resilience to tampering, smart contracts are appealing in many scenarios, especially in those which require transfers of money to respect certain agreed rules (like in financial services and in games). Over the last few years many platforms for smart contracts have been proposed, and some of them have been actually implemented and used. We study how the notion of smart contract is interpreted in some of these platforms. Focussing on the two most widespread ones, Bitcoin and Ethereum, we quantify the usage of smart contracts in relation to their application domain. We also analyse the most common programming patterns in Ethereum, where the source code of smart contracts is available.},

abstract = {Blockchain, as one of the core technologies in Bitcoin that is the most representative cryptocurrency, has received extensive attentions recently. Blockchain can be used as a peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized system to store the pseudonymous transaction records in a trustless environment. It is believed that blockchain can be used in a diversity of future Internet interaction systems, such as smart contracts, public services, Internet of Things (IoT), reputation systems and security services rather than financial systems only. However, a number of technical challenges prohibit the wide application of blockchain. Therefore, we present a comprehensive survey on blockchain technologies. In particular, we first provide an overview of blockchain technologies and a taxonomy of various blockchain systems. We then enumerate a number of both current and future blockchain applications. We also discuss the challenges in this promising area and discuss the future directions.},

abstract = {We study the robustness of networks under node removal, considering random node failure, as well as targeted node attacks based on network centrality measures. Whilst both of these have been studied in the literature, existing approaches tend to study random failure in terms of average-case behavior, giving no idea of how badly network performance can degrade purely by chance. Instead of considering average network performance under random failure, we compute approximate network performance probability density functions as functions of the fraction of nodes removed. We find that targeted attacks based on centrality measures give a good indication of the worst-case behavior of a network. We show that many centrality measures produce similar targeted attacks and that a combination of degree centrality and eigenvector centrality may be enough to evaluate worst-case behavior of networks. Finally, we study the robustness envelope and targeted attack responses of networks that are rewired to have high-and low-degree assortativities, discovering that moderate assortativity increases confer more robustness against targeted attacks whilst moderate decreases confer more robustness against random uniform attacks.},

abstract = {This paper studies the efficiency and price formation of bitcoin and other cryptocur-rency markets. First, there are large recurrent arbitrage opportunities in cryptocur-rency prices relative to fiat currencies across exchanges that often persist for several days or weeks. These price dispersions exist even in the face of significant trading volumes on many of the exchanges. The total size of arbitrage profits just from December 2017 to February 2018 is above of $1 billion. Second, arbitrage opportunities are much larger across than within the same region; they are particularly large between the US, Japan and Korea, but smaller between the US and Europe. But spreads are much smaller when trading one cryptocurrency against another, suggesting that cross-border controls on fiat currencies play an important role. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common component and an idiosyncratic, exchange-specific one. We show that the common component explains up to 85% of the variation in bitcoin returns and that the idiosyncratic components of order flow play an important role in explaining the size of the arbitrage spreads between exchanges.},

Our primary goals are to better understand Tor as it is deployed and through this understanding, propose improvements. In particular, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) How is Tor being used? (2) How is Tor being mis-used? (3) Who is using Tor?

To sample the results, we show that web traffic makes up the majority of the connections and bandwidth, but non-interactive protocols consume a disproportionately large amount of bandwidth when compared to interactive protocols. We provide a survey of how Tor is being misused, both by clients and by Tor router operators. In particular, we develop a method for detecting exit router logging (in certain cases). Finally, we present evidence that Tor is used throughout the world, but router participation is limited to only a few countries.},

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization represent over $160 billion dollars in combined value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced signiﬁcant price swings on both daily and long term valuations. Twitter is increasingly used as a news source inﬂuencing purchase decisions by informing users of the currency and its increasing popularity. As a result, quickly understanding the impact of tweets on price direction can provide a purchasing and selling advantage to a cryptocurrency user or a trader. By analyzing tweets, we found that tweet volume, rather than tweet sentiment (which is invariably overall positive regardless of price direction), is a predictor of price direction. By utilizing a linear model that takes as input tweets and Google Trends data, we were able to accurately predict the direction of price changes. By utilizing this model, a person is able to make better informed purchase and selling decisions related to Bitcoin and Ethereum.},

abstract = {The Ripple credit network has emerged as a payment backbone with key advantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and altcoins), and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond. This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the IOU credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the core of the network and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112, 000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid-July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their IOU credit links.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs running on cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains, whose popularity stem from the possibility to perform financial transactions, such as payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without need for any trusted third party. Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed. In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable code that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite. Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security properties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools for Ethereum smart contracts, thereby demonstrating once more the importance of rigorous semantic foundations for the design of security verification techniques.},

abstract = {We develop a theory of financing of entrepreneurial ventures via an initial coin offering (ICO). Pre-selling a venture's output by issuing tokens allows the entrepreneur to transfer part of the venture risk to diversified investors without diluting her control rights. This, however, leads to an agency conflict between the entrepreneur and investors that manifests itself in underinvestment. We show that an ICO can dominate traditional venture capital (VC) financing when VC investors are under-diversified, when the idiosyncratic component of venture risk is large enough, when the payoff distribution is sufficiently right-skewed, and when the degree of information asymmetry between the entrepreneur and ICO investors is not too large. Overall, our model suggests that an ICO can be a viable financing alternative for some but not all entrepreneurial ventures. An implication is that while regulating ICOs to reduce the information asymmetry associated with them is desirable, banning them outright is not.},

abstract = {The rise of smart contracts-autonomous applications running on blockchains-has led to a growing number of threats, necessitating sophisticated program analysis. However, smart contracts, which transact valuable tokens and cryptocur-rencies, are compiled to very low-level bytecode. It is estimated that high-level source code is publicly available for under 1% of contracts on Ethereum (the most popular smart contract blockchain). We present the Gigahorse toolchain. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a high-level 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data-and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract's source, and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts. Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts-e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler. Importantly, Gigahorse offers a full-featured toolchain for further analyses (and a "batteries included" approach, with multiple clients already implemented), together with the highest performance and scalability. Key to these improvements is Gigahorse's use of a declarative, logic-based specification, which allows high-level insights to inform low-level decompilation.},

abstract = {Designing a secure permissionless distributed ledger (blockchain) that performs on par with centralized payment processors, such as Visa, is a challenging task. Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow their total processing capacity with the number of validators; and those that do, compromise security or decentralization. We present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that preserves longterm security under permissionless operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient cross-shard commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards. OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and low-latency 'trust-but-verify' validation for low-value transactions. An evaluation of our experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of active validators, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.},

abstract = {The surge of interest in cryptocurrencies has been accompanied by a proliferation of fraud. This paper examines a pervasive tactic long known to financial markets: pump and dump schemes. While the fundamentals of the ruse have not changed in the last century, the recent explosion of nearly 2,000 cryptocurrencies in a largely unregulated environment has greatly expanded the scope for abuse. The paper first quantifies the scope of cryptocurrency pump and dump on Discord and Telegram, two widely popular group messaging platforms with 130 million users and 200 million users respectively. Both platforms can handle large groups with thousands of users, and they are the most popular outlets for pump and dump schemes involving cryptocurrencies. We identified 3,767 different pump signals advertised on Telegram and another 1,051 different pump signals advertised on Discord during a six-month period in 2018. The schemes promoted more than 300 cryptocurrencies. This comprehensive data provides the first measure of the scope of pump and dump schemes across cryptocurrencies and suggest that this phenomenon is widespread and often quite profitable. This should raise concerns among regulators. We then examine which factors that affect the "success" of the pump, as measured by the percentage increase in price near the pump signal. We find that the coin's rank (market capitalization/volume) is the most important factor in determining the profitability of the pump: pumping obscure coins (with low volume) is much more profitable than pumping the dominant coins in the ecosystem.},

It also attracts scams, for example, Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.},

We investigate all facets of anonymity in Zcash's transactions, ranging from its transparent transactions to the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately. We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage.},

Meanwhile, generating decentralized consensus entails distributing information which necessarily alters the informational environment. We analyze how decentralization affects consensus effectiveness, and how the quintessential features of blockchain reshape industrial organization and the landscape of competition. Smart contracts can mitigate informational asymmetry and improve welfare and consumer surplus through enhanced entry and competition, yet the irreducible distribution of information during consensus generation may encourage greater collusion. In general, blockchains can sustain market equilibria with a wider range of economic outcomes. We further discuss antitrust policy implications targeted to blockchain applications, such as separating consensus record-keepers from users.},

Although these so-called “altcoins” often have smaller trading volumes they sometimes attract large attention on social media.

abstract = {Despite growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, making fast payments at scale remains a challenge. Payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning Network have emerged as a viable scaling solution. However, completing payments on PCNs is challenging: payments must be routed on paths with sufficient funds. As payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction, the channel eventually becomes depleted and cannot support further payments in that direction; hence, naive routing schemes like shortest-path routing can deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system. Today's PCNs also route payments atomically, worsening the problem. In this paper, we present Spider, a routing solution that “packetizes” transactions and uses a multi-path transport protocol to achieve high-throughput routing in PCNs. Packetization allows Spider to complete even large transactions on low-capacity payment channels over time, while the multi-path congestion control protocol ensures balanced utilization of channels and fairness across flows. Extensive simulations comparing Spider with state-of-the-art approaches shows that Spider requires less than 25% of the funds to successfully route over 95% of transactions on balanced traffic demands, and offloads 4x more transactions onto the PCN on imbalanced demands.},

abstract = {EOS is a popular cryptocurrency, whose market cap is over seven billion USD. Its ecosystem operates in the EOS.IO system, which is devised to speed up the slow transaction rate of previous blockchain technologies. Whereas many previous studies have investigated the security issues of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the security of EOS.IO has thus far drawn little attention despite its popularity. Even the studies that have addressed the security of EOS and its underlying blockchain system mostly focused on implementational bugs in the core of the EOS.IO system or in smart contracts, rather than addressing the fundamental problems stemming from the EOS.IO design. To address this void in the previous literature, we investigate the design architecture of EOS.IO. Based on this investigation , we introduce four attacks whose root causes stem from the unique characteristics of EOS.IO, including intentionally slowing down the block creation time-which can disrupt the essential functions of its blockchain and incapacitate the entire EOS.IO system. In addition, we find that an adversary can partially freeze the execution of a target smart contract or maliciously consume all the resources of a target user with crafted requests. We report all the identified threats to the EOS.IO foundation, one of which is confirmed to be fatal. Finally, we discuss possible mitigations against the proposed attacks.},

abstract = {In cryptoeconomic protocols, ,nancial deposits are fundamental to their security. Protocol designers and their agents face a trade-oo when choosing the deposit size. While substantial deposits might increase the protocol security, for example by minimising the impact of adversarial behaviour or risks of currency yuctuations, locked-up capital incurs opportunity costs for agents. Moreover, some protocols require over-collateralization in anticipation of future events and malicious intentions of agents. We present Balance, an application-agnostic system that reduces over-collateralization without compromising protocol security. In Balance, malicious agents receive no additional utility for cheating once their deposits are reduced. At the same time, honest and rational agents increase their utilities for behaving honestly as their opportunity costs for the locked-up deposits are reduced. Balance is a round-based mechanism in which agents need to continuously perform desired actions. Rather than treating agents' incentives and behaviour as ancillary, we explicitly model agents' utility, proving the conditions for incentive compatibility. BBBBBBB improves social welfare given a distribution of honest, rational, and malicious agents. Further, we integrate Balance with a cross-chain interoperability protocol, XCLAIM, reducing deposits by 10% while maintaining the same utility for behaving honestly. Our implementation allows any number of agents to be maintained for at most 55,287 gas (≈ USD 0.07) to update the agents' scores, and at a cost of 54,948 gas (≈ USD 0.07) to update the assignment of agents to layers.},

abstract = {An atomic cross-chain swap is a distributed coordination task where multiple parties exchange assets across multiple blockchains, for example, trading bitcoin for ether. An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair (D, L), where D = (V, A) is a strongly-connected directed graph and L ⊂ V a feedback vertex set for D, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for D, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in L generate the hashlocked secrets. We show that no such protocol is possible if D is not strongly connected, or if D is strongly connected but L is not a feedback vertex set. The protocol has time complexity O(diam(D)) and space complexity (bits stored on all blockchains) O(|A|2).},

abstract = {Cyber attacks on both databases and critical infrastructure have threatened public and private sectors. Meanwhile, ubiquitous tracking and wearable computing have infringed upon privacy. Advocates and engineers have recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception, however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of meanings. In this paper, we survey 24 articles from 2007-2017 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their incentive structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models which can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work. Our taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for understanding different types of defensive deception commonly encountered in cybersecurity and privacy.},

While doing research for our last paper on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, we detected that there is a possibility of earning an interest without counterparty risk. We put our heads together to ponder this interesting idea, which raised the question of how derivatives on Bitcoin are actually priced since no base rate is available. We conducted a quantitative analysis by calculating the implied interest rates of Bitcoin futures with different maturities. The results revealed that there are some similarities with the borrowing and lending rates that are used in the digital asset ecosystem. An additional thought experiment about the pricing of Bitcoin futures using the Lightning Network Reference Rate showed that this rate might serve as Bitcoin's base rate and thus increase transparency in the pricing process.},

@inproceedings{Sergey2018,
abstract = {Distributed systems play a crucial role in modern infrastructure, but are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. This difficulty arises from two main challenges: (a) correctly implementing core system components (e.g., two-phase commit), so all their internal invariants hold, and (b) correctly composing standalone system components into functioning trustworthy applications (e.g., persistent storage built on top of a two-phase commit instance). Recent work has developed several approaches for addressing (a) by means of mechanically verifying implementations of core distributed components, but no methodology exists to address (b) by composing such verified components into larger verified applications. As a result, expensive verification efforts for key system components are not easily reusable, which hinders further verification efforts.

In this paper, we present Disel, the first framework for implementation and compositional verification of distributed systems and their clients, all within the mechanized, foundational context of the Coq proof assistant. In Disel, users implement distributed systems using a domain specific language shallowly embedded in Coq and providing both high-level programming constructs as well as low-level communication primitives. Components of composite systems are specified in Disel as protocols, which capture system-specific logic and disentangle system definitions from implementation details. By virtue of Disel's dependent type system, well-typed implementations always satisfy their protocols' invariants and never go wrong, allowing users to verify system implementations interactively using Disel's Hoare-style program logic, which extends state-of-the-art techniques for concurrency verification to the distributed setting. By virtue of the substitution principle and frame rule provided by Disel's logic, system components can be composed leading to modular, reusable verified distributed systems.

We describe Disel, illustrate its use with a series of examples, outline its logic and metatheory, and report on our experience using it as a framework for implementing, specifying, and verifying distributed systems.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is a strong need for achieving interoperability between unconnected ledgers. Approaches such as hash time lock contracts (HTLCs) have arisen for cross-chain asset exchange. The solution embraces the likelihood of transaction failure and attempts to "make the best out of worst" by allowing transacting agents to at least keep their original assets in case of an abort. Nonetheless, as an undesired outcome, reoccurring transaction failures prompt a critical and analytical examination of the protocol. In this study, we propose a game-theoretic framework to study the strategic behaviors of agents taking part in cross-chain atomic swaps implemented with HTLCs. We study the success rate of the transaction as a function of the swap rate, the token price and its volatility, as well as other variables. We demonstrate that both agents might decide not to follow the protocol in an attempt to exploit price variations so as to maximize one's own utility. An extension of our model confirms that collateral deposits can improve the transaction success rate, and motivates further research towards collateralization without a trusted third party.},

abstract = {Online communication media such as email, instant mes-saging, bulletin boards, voice-over-IP, and social networking sites allow any sender to reach potentially millions of users at near zero marginal cost. This property enables information to be exchanged freely: anyone with Internet access can publish content. Unfortunately, the same property opens the door to unwanted communication , marketing, and propaganda. Examples include email spam, Web search engine spam, inappropriately labeled content on YouTube, and unwanted contact invitations in Skype. Unwanted communication wastes one of the most valuable resources in the information age: human attention. In this paper, we explore the use of trust relationships, such as social links, to thwart unwanted communication. Such relationships already exist in many application settings today. Our system, Ostra, bounds the total amount of unwanted communication a user can produce based on the number of trust relationships the user has, and relies on the fact that it is difficult for a user to create arbitrarily many trust relationships. Ostra is applicable to both messaging systems such as email and content-sharing systems such as YouTube. It does not rely on automatic classification of content, does not require global user authentication, respects each re-cipient's idea of unwanted communication, and permits legitimate communication among parties who have not had prior contact. An evaluation based on data gathered from an online social networking site shows that Ostra effectively thwarts unwanted communication while not impeding legitimate communication.},

New technologies are often a major challenge to the field of digital forensics due to the technical and legal challenges they introduce. This paper provides a set of tutorials for Bitcoin that allows for learners from both backgrounds to be taught how it operates, and how it may impact on their working practice. Earlier this year they were delivered to a cohort of third year undergraduates. To the author's knowledge, this represents the first integration of the topic into a digital forensics programme by a higher education provider.},

The initial model showed several similarities to gold and the dollar indicating hedging capabilities and advantages as a medium of exchange. The asymmetric GARCH showed that bitcoin may be useful in risk management and ideal for risk averse investors in anticipation of negative shocks to the market. Overall bitcoin has a place on the financial markets and in portfolio management as it can be classified as something in between gold and the American dollar on a scale from pure medium of exchange advantages to pure store of value advantages.},

abstract = {Soon after its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has been adopted by cyber-criminals, which rely on its pseudonymity to implement virtually untraceable scams. One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has attracted a great deal of attentions as an effective way to innovate business processes. It has to be integrated with other Business Process Management system (BPM) components to implement specified functionalities related to the applications. The current efforts in integrating this technology into BPM are at a very early stage. To apply Blockchain into business processes efficiently, Blockchain and business process characteristics must be identified. Inconsistency of confirmation settlement that heavily relies on the implementation of consensus protocol poses a major challenge in business process operations, especially ones that are time-critical. In addition, validators, nodes responsible for performing consensus operations in a Blockchain system, can introduce bias and as a result are not trustable. This paper first defines Blockchain and also investigates the characteristics of Blockchain and business processes. Then, we suggest an architecture of business processes in Blockchain era to overcome the problems of time inconsistency and consensus bias. The architecture provides persistency, validity, auditability, and disintermediary that Blockchain offers. The architecture also provides flexibility by allowing business partner to select nodes in performing consensus; thus bias is mitigated.},

The illegal share of bitcoin activity declines with mainstream interest in bitcoin and with the emergence of more opaque cryptocurrencies. The techniques developed in this paper have applications in cryptocurrency surveillance.

abstract = {Scalability has been a bottleneck for major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite the significantly improved scalability claimed by several high--profile blockchain projects, there has been little effort to understand how their transactional throughput is being used. In this paper, we examine recent network traffic of three major high-scalability blockchains--EOSIO, Tezos and XRP Ledger (XRPL)--over a period of seven months. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of the transactions are used for value transfer purposes. In particular, 96% of the transactions on EOSIO were triggered by the airdrop of a currently valueless token; on Tezos, 76% of throughput was used for maintaining consensus; and over 94% of transactions on XRPL carried no economic value. We also identify a persisting airdrop on EOSIO as a DoS attack and detect a two-month-long spam attack on XRPL. The paper explores the different designs of the three blockchains and sheds light on how they could shape user behavior.},

abstract = {<p>Machine learning research has gained momentum—also in finance. Consequently, initial machine-learning-based statistical arbitrage strategies have emerged in the U.S. equities markets in the academic literature, see e.g., Takeuchi and Lee (2013); Moritz and Zimmermann (2014); Krauss et al. (2017). With our paper, we pose the question how such a statistical arbitrage approach would fare in the cryptocurrency space on minute-binned data. Specifically, we train a random forest on lagged returns of 40 cryptocurrency coins, with the objective to predict whether a coin outperforms the cross-sectional median of all 40 coins over the subsequent 120 min. We buy the coins with the top-3 predictions and short-sell the coins with the flop-3 predictions, only to reverse the positions after 120 min. During the out-of-sample period of our backtest, ranging from 18 June 2018 to 17 September 2018, and after more than 100,000 trades, we find statistically and economically significant returns of 7.1 bps per day, after transaction costs of 15 bps per half-turn. While this finding poses a challenge to the semi-strong from of market efficiency, we critically discuss it in light of limits to arbitrage, focusing on total volume constraints of the presented intraday-strategy.</p>},

The question that remains however is whether its price movements are linked with its transaction activity - a critical element of its growing market microstructure. Using number of Bitcoin transactions and unique addresses, respectively, to proxy for transaction activity, it is shown that a one standard deviation shock to transaction activity leads to just over a 0.30% gain in returns on the third day following the shock. By the sixth day, there is a reversal in price behavior and any such gains are expunged. When comparing the bidirectional linkages between returns and transaction activity, it is shown here that the contribution of return shocks to transaction activity is quantitatively larger in magnitude.},

Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, has $\sim$22K users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations.},

We propose a cryptographic approach for solving information leakage problems in distributed ledgers that relies on using a hash (or fingerprint) to secure time priority, followed by a second communication that reveals more features of the underlying market transaction—in effect using a transaction's fingerprint to hide its footprint. Solving the information leakage problem greatly expands the potential applications of private distributed ledger technology to include trading.},

abstract = {Ponzi schemes are financial frauds which lure users under the promise of high profits. Actually, users are repaid only with the investments of new users joining the scheme: consequently, a Ponzi scheme implodes soon after users stop joining it. Originated in the offline world 150 years ago, Ponzi schemes have since then migrated to the digital world, approaching first the Web, and more recently hanging over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum have provided a new opportunity for scammers, who have now the possibility of creating “trustworthy” frauds that still make users lose money, but at least are guaranteed to execute “correctly”. We present a comprehensive survey of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum, analysing their behaviour and their impact from various viewpoints.},

Dollars are supplied by a central bank to achieve its inflation target, while the Bitcoin supply grows deterministically.

This paper outlines general guidelines for designing JIT analyses. We also present a general recipe for turning static data-flow analyses into JIT analyses through a concept of layered analysis execution il-lustrated through Cheetah, a JIT taint analysis for Android applications. Our evaluation of Cheetah on real-world applications and our user study show that JIT analyses are able to present those warnings that are of importance to the code developers just-in-time, allowing them to start fixing problems immediately, without losing their context. Furthermore, study par-ticipants consistently reported higher satisfaction levels with Cheetah compared to its traditional counterpart.},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {Maternal obesity due to long-term high-fat diet (HFD) consumption leads to faster growth in offspring during suckling, and increased adiposity at 20 days of age. Decreased expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and increased anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression were observed in the fed state. However, hunger is the major drive to eat and hypothalamic appetite regulators change in response to meals. Therefore, it is important to compare both satiated and fasting states. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were fed a cafeteria-style HFD (15.33 kJ/g) or chow for 5 weeks before mating, with the same diet continuing throughout gestation and lactation. At postnatal day 20, male pups were killed either after overnight fasting or in the fed state. Pups from obese dams were hyperphagic during both pre- and postweaning periods. Pups from obese dams had higher hypothalamic mRNA expression of POMC and NPY Y1 receptor, but lower hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and its downstream target single-minded gene 1 (Sim1), in the fed state. Overnight fasting reduced circulating glucose, insulin, and leptin and increased hypothalamic NPY Y1 receptor mRNA in pups from both lean and obese dams. Hypothalamic NPY and agouti-related protein (AgRP) were only increased by fasting in pups from obese dams; reductions in MC4R and Sim1 were only seen in pups from lean dams. At weaning, the suppressed orexigenic signals in offspring from obese dams were normalized after overnight fasting, although anorexigenic signaling appeared impaired in these animals. This may contribute to their hyperphagia and faster growth.},

abstract = {Correlation measures are a key element of statistics and machine learning, and essential for a wide range of data analysis tasks. Most existing correlation measures are for pairwise relationships, but real-world data can also exhibit complex multivariate correlations, involving three or more variables. We argue that multivariate correlation measures should be comparable, interpretable, scalable and unbiased. However, no existing measures satisfy all these requirements. In this paper, we propose an unbiased multivariate correlation measure, called UMC, which satisfies all the above criteria. UMC is a cumulative entropy based non-parametric multivariate correlation measure, which can capture both linear and non-linear correlations for groups of three or more variables. It employs a correction for chance using a statistical model of independence to address the issue of bias. UMC has high interpretability and we empirically show it outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate correlation measures in terms of statistical power, as well as for use in both subspace clustering and outlier detection tasks.},

abstract = {A bona fide currency functions as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account, but bitcoin largely fails to satisfy these criteria. Bitcoin has achieved only scant consumer transaction volume, with an average well below one daily transaction for the few merchants who accept it. Its volatility is greatly higher than the volatilities of widely used currencies, imposing large short-term risk upon users. Bitcoin's daily exchange rates exhibit virtually zero correlation with widely used currencies and with gold, making bitcoin useless for risk management and exceedingly difficult for its owners to hedge. Bitcoin prices of consumer goods require many decimal places with leading zeros, which is disconcerting to retail market participants. Bitcoin faces daily hacking and theft risks, lacks access to a banking system with deposit insurance, and is not used to denominate consumer credit or loan contracts. Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than a currency.},

The ability to create pseudoanonymous financial transactions using bitcoins has made the currency attractive to users who value their privacy.

We propose a novel approach to creating and evaluating such mappings solely using real-time transaction traffic collected over 5 months. We developed heuristics for identifying ownership relationships between Bitcoin addresses and IP addresses. We discuss the circumstances under which these relationships become apparent and demonstrate how nearly 1,000 Bitcoin addresses can be mapped to their likely owner IPs by leveraging anomalous relaying behavior.},

A user interacts with Ethereum by writing programs and having miners execute them for a fee charged on-the-fly based on the complexity of the execution. The exact fee, measured in gas consumption, in general depends on the unknown Ethereum state, and predicting even its worst case is in principle undecidable. Uncertainty in gas consumption may result in inefficiency, loss of money, and, in extreme cases, in funds being locked for an indeterminate duration. This feasibility study presents two methods for determining the exact worst-case gas consumption of a bounded Ethereum execution using methods influenced by symbolic model checking. We give several concrete cases where gas consumption estimation is needed, and provide two approaches for determining gas consumption, one based on symbolically enumerating execution paths, and the other based on computing paths modularly based on the program structure.},

@article{Ainsworth2017,
abstract = {Following years of study the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) appears ready to adopt the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and put in place a tax system that will stabilize revenue.  A value added tax (VAT) and corporate income tax (CIT) are considered.  A VAT Framework Agreement, that functions like the VAT Directive in the EU, has been agreed.  Although new, the GCC VAT is very worthy of attention. From a tax policy perspective, it is making notable improvements to EU VAT design. The GCC VAT is (potentially) the world's first real-time, blockchain-secured, multi-jurisdictional VAT. This is a remarkable accomplishment, and it indicates that the GCC has learned and applied a number of global VAT and technology lessons.  One of the most visible flaws in the EU VAT is its openness to cross-border frauds – both intra-community and extra-community frauds. Missing traders are the problem.  This is what the GCC has corrected.  The perpetrators of tax fraud are not at all concerned about the specific tax law that they are abusing; they are looking solely at revenue streams, and the probability that they will get caught.  As a result, when a fraudster finds a single activity that attacks multiple tax systems, it becomes a favored vector, and we find a nexus of frauds clustered around a unitary fraud operation.  The government's perspective is just the opposite of the fraudster's.  A focus on one kind of tax fraud may well resolve many more kinds of fraud.  This appears to be what will happen as the GCC VAT is rolled out after January 1, 2018.  The example considered in this paper involves the illicit cigarette trade.  By resolving missing trader frauds, the GCC may (unintentionally) make a serious dent in the illicit cigarette trade and the theft of cigarette tax revenues (a manufacturer's tax), precisely because the operation of the GCC VAT will increase the cigarette fraudster's probability of detection.  A “tax fraud nexus” that could easily be replicated in the GCC (if an unmodified EU-style VAT were to be adopted) can be seen in the Danish chocolate frauds. These frauds were examined in the first program of the three part Danish documentary, How Fraudulent Denmark (S{\aa}dan Svindles Danmark).  The documentary appeared on DR TV January 12 and 25, and February 1, 2016. The fraud vehicle was candy that was re-sold by traders who purchased expired chocolate from the Mars Denmark Company. The primary fraud, re-packaging and then re-selling expired chocolate was carried out in a manner that attacked two tax regimes – the chocolate tax (a manufacturer's tax) and the VAT (a consumption tax).  This scheme funded organized crime; a different scheme examined in the second program of the documentary funded Islamic terrorists.   The GCC seems to be very aware of the missing trader fraud discussed in the documentary. Technology innovations that will suppress it are set out in Article 71 of the GCC Framework Agreement.  No other VAT Framework or VAT Directive has such a provision.  One of the tax-related side benefits from resolving missing trader fraud in the GCC VAT will likely be the suppression of cigarette smuggling, and the recovery of important revenues from the cigarette tax, which has been raised to a 200% levy.  If Denmark had a VAT provision similar to Article 71 it would likely solve the VAT and Chocolate Tax frauds considered in the documentary.},

Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual diffusion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader diffusion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.},

From the initial cryptocurrency to the current smart contract, blockchain has been applied to many fields. Although there are some studies on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, there lacks a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We also review the security enhancement solutions for blockchain, which could be used in the development of various blockchain systems, and suggest some future directions to stir research efforts into this area.},

We investigate whether the introduction of futures trading in Bitcoin is able to resolve the issues that stopped Bitcoin from being considered a currency. Our analysis shows that spot volatility has increased following the appearance of futures contracts, that futures contracts are not an effective hedging instrument, and that price discovery is driven by uninformed investors in the spot market. We therefore argue that the conclusion that Bitcoin is a speculative asset rather than a currency is not altered by the introduction of futures trading.},

abstract = {Bonding curves are continuous liquidity mechanisms which are used in market design for cryptographically-supported token economies. Tokens are atomic units of state information which are cryptographically verifiable in peer-to-peer networks. Bonding curves are an example of an enforceable mechanism through which participating agents influence this state. By designing such mechanisms, an engineer may establish the topo-logical structure of a token economy without presupposing the utilities or associated actions of the agents within that economy. This is accomplished by introducing configuration spaces, which are proper subsets of the global state space representing all achievable states under the designed mechanisms. Any global properties true for all points in the configuration space are true for all possible sequences of actions on the part of agents. This paper generalizes the notion of a bonding curve to formalize the relationship between cryptographically enforced mechanisms and their associated configuration spaces, using invariant properties of conservation functions. We then proceed to apply this framework to analyze the augmented bonding curve design, which is currently under development by a project in the non-profit funding sector.},

Understanding the possible behaviors of a smart contract is difficult, which complicates development, auditing, and the post-mortem analysis of attacks. This paper presents the first specification mining technique for smart contracts. Our technique extracts the possible behaviors of smart contracts from contract executions recorded on a blockchain and expresses them as finite automata. A novel dependency analysis allows us to separate independent interactions with a contract. Our technique tunes the abstractions for the automata construction automatically based on configurable metrics, for instance, to maximize readability or precision.

abstract = {Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, Twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on Twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from Twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from Twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets.},

Given a program and some measure of cost, we first produce recurrence relations (RRs) which capture the cost of our program in terms of the size of its input data. Second, we convert such RRs into closed form (i.e., without recurrences). Whereas the first phase has received considerable attention, with a number of cost analyses available for a variety of programming languages, the second phase has received comparatively little attention. In this paper we first study the features of RRs generated by automatic cost analysis and discuss why existing computer algebra systems are not appropriate for automatically obtaining closed form solutions nor upper bounds of them. Then we present, to our knowledge, the first practical framework for the fully automatic generation of reasonably accurate upper bounds of RRs originating from cost analysis of a wide range of programs. It is based on the inference of ranking functions and loop invariants and on partial evaluation.},

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) are software codes which reside and run over a blockchain. The code can be written in different languages with the common purpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting blockchain, They are ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order to satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must satisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from traditional software code. In particular, since the bytecode is uploaded in the hosting blockchain, size, computational resources, interaction between different parts of software are all limited and even if the specific software languages implement more or less the same constructs of traditional languages there is not the same freedom as in normal software development. SC software is expected to reflect these constrains on SC software metrics which should display metric values characteristic of the domain and different from more traditional software metrics. We tested this hypothesis on the code of more than twelve thousands SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum blockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository and computed the statistics of a set of software metrics related to SC and compared them to the metrics extracted from more traditional software projects. Our results show that generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more restricted than the corresponding metrics in traditional software systems. Some of the stylized facts, like power law in the tail of the distribution of some metrics, are only approximate but the lines of code follow a log normal distribution which reminds of the same behavior already found in traditional software systems.},

One of the main incarnations of this idea is triple-entry accounting or TEA, a revolutionary design, popularized by Ian Grigg, and with many emerging applications in distributed ledger technology. While TEA has begun to catch the attention of the scientific community, its historical development remains under-researched. As a consequence, an important historical influence in its development remains unrecognized to date: Resource-Event-Agent (REA) accounting model. This paper sets out to fill in these gaps, conducting a genealogical analysis of TEA. In tracing the evolution of TEA, we correct common misconceptions and investigate the largely forgotten influence of William E. McCarthy and the “missing link” of Todd Boyle.},

This hints at Bitcoin's amorphous nature: Is this a monetary or a corporate measure? Hard values become explicit in the processing of transactions and the digital mining of Bitcoins. Electricity is a primary input cost. Bitcoins earned are often used to circumvent local currency controls and acquire US dollars. For the period August 2010 to February 2018, we examine the financial components of Bitcoin mining revenues, their statistical contribution to daily changes, and to its variance.

In this paper, we introduce four different methods in machine learning including three typical machine learning models: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and one attention-based neural network. The main task is to predict the next day's index price according to the historical data. The dataset consists of the SP500 index, CSI300 index and Nikkei225 index from three different financial markets representing the most developed market, the less developed market and the developing market respectively. Seven variables are chosen as the inputs containing the daily trading data, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables. The results show that the attention-based model has the best performance among the alternative models. Furthermore, all the introduced models have better accuracy in the developed financial market than developing ones.},

abstract = {Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts can have potentially devastating financial consequences. In light of this, several regulatory bodies have called for a need to audit smart contracts for security and correctness guarantees. Unfortunately, auditing smart contracts that do not have readily available source code can be challenging , and there are currently few tools available that aid in this process. Such contracts remain opaque to auditors. To address this, we present Erays, a reverse engineering tool for smart contracts. Erays takes in smart contract from the Ethereum blockchain, and produces high-level pseudocode suitable for manual analysis. We show how Erays can be used to provide insight into several contract properties, such as code complexity and code reuse in the ecosystem. We then leverage Erays to link contracts with no previously available source code to public source code, thus reducing the overall opacity in the ecosystem. Finally, we demonstrate how Erays can be used for reverse-engineering in four case studies: high-value multi-signature wallets, arbitrage bots, exchange accounts, and finally, a popular smart-contract game, Cryptokitties. We conclude with a discussion regarding the value of reverse engineering in the smart contract ecosystem, and how Erays can be leveraged to address the challenges that lie ahead.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a conceptual framework to investigate the effects of central bank independence, of the degree of centralization of wage bargaining and of the interaction between those institutional variables, on real wages, unemployment and inflation. The labor market is characterized by the degree of centralization of bargaining and by the degree of trade unions' inflation aversion. The latter leads each union to moderate its wage demands in order to induce the Central Bank (CB) to inflate at a lower rate. An increase in the degree of centralization of wage bargaining (a decrease in the number of unions) triggers two opposite effects on real wages, unemployment and inflation. The decrease in the number of unions reduces the substitutability between the labors of different unions and therefore the degree of effective competition between them. This reduced competition effect raises real wages, unemployment and inflation. But the decrease in the number of unions also strengthens the moderating effect of inflationary fears on the real wage demands of each union. This strategic effect lowers real wages, unemployment and inflation. The interaction between those two effects produces a Calmfors-Driffill type relation between real wages and centralization. The paper analyzes the effects of centralization and of independence on the position and the shape of this Calmfors-Driffill relation, as well as on inflation and unemployment. Some of the resulting implications are tested empirically, using data from 19 developed economies. Implications for the optimal degree of conservativeness and for European Monetary Union (EMU) are also discussed.},

abstract = {The decentralized I owe you (IOU) transaction network Ripple is gaining prominence as a fast, low-cost and efficient method for performing same and cross-currency payments. Ripple keeps track of IOU credit its users have granted to their business partners or friends, and settles transactions between two connected Ripple wallets by appropriately changing credit values on the connecting paths. Similar to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, while the ownership of the wallets is implicitly pseudonymous in Ripple, IOU credit links and transaction flows between wallets are publicly available in an on-line ledger. In this paper, we present the first thorough study that analyzes this globally visible log and characterizes the privacy issues with the current Ripple network. In particular, we define two novel heuristics and perform heuristic clustering to group wallets based on observations on the Ripple network graph. We then propose reidentification mechanisms to deanonymize the operators of those clusters and show how to reconstruct the financial activities of deanonymized Ripple wallets. Our analysis motivates the need for better privacy-preserving payment mechanisms for Ripple and characterizes the privacy challenges faced by the emerging credit networks.},

It achieves fairness, in the sense that it is difficult for an attacker to manip-ulate which of two transactions will be chosen to be first in the consensus order. It has complete asynchrony, no leaders, no round robin, no proof-of-work, eventual consensus with probability one, and high speed in the absence of faults. It is based on a gossip protocol, in which the participants don't just gossip about transactions. They gossip about gossip. They jointly build a hashgraph reflecting all of the gossip events. This allows Byzantine agreement to be achieved through virtual voting. Alice does not send Bob a vote over the Internet. Instead, Bob calculates what vote Alice would have sent, based on his knowledge of what Alice knows. This yields fair Byzantine agreement on a total order for all transactions, with very little communication overhead beyond the transactions themselves.},

Very little concrete ground truth (i.e., ads deenitively known to be posted by a traacker) exists in this space. In this work, we develop tools and techniques that can be used separately and in conjunction to group sex ads by their true owner (and not the claimed author in the ad). Speciically, we develop a machine learning classiier that uses stylometry to distinguish between ads posted by the same vs. diierent authors with 90% TPR and 1% FPR. We also design a linking technique that takes advantage of leakages from the Bitcoin mempool, blockchain and sex ad site, to link a subset of sex ads to Bitcoin public wallets and transactions. Finally, we demonstrate via a 4-week proof of concept using Backpage as the sex ad site, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to potentially ynd human traackers.},

This paper develops a model to address several basic questions: What determines the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency? How would market trading interact with its fundamentals in an uncertain and opaque environment? In our model, a cryp-tocurrency constitutes membership in a platform developed to facilitate transactions of certain goods or services. The complementarity in the households' participation in the platform acts as an endogenous, yet fragile, fundamental of the cryptocurrency. There exist either two or no equilibria, and the two equilib-ria, when they exist, have disparate properties. When the transaction demand for the platform is unobservable, the trading price and volume of the cryptocurrency serve as important channels for not only aggregating private information about its fundamental, but also facilitating coordination on a certain equilibrium.

abstract = {his is a forthcoming paper in European Property Law Journal. (I have no idea why here I cannot change "preprint" to "accepted"). This paper presents a concept of real estate tokenization, which includes legal, technological, and organizational aspects. The research introduces a theory of a Title Token-a digital record of ownership on the blockchain. It is discussed the principle of technological neutrality, where the traditional land registry is not necessarily abandoned in favor of blockchains, but instead, people gain the right to choose. Nowadays, public administrations use central-server databases, giving no alternatives for citizens. Recognition of the right of citizens to choose which technology to apply for managing their property rights creates a basis for free competition and the development of new technologies for better public services. Decentralized distributed ledgers are the key to decentralization. They enable more secure automation of legal procedures. On the contrary, centralization is a source of many issues in governance: abuse of power, corruption, inefficient governance, and high costs, slowness and complexity of bureaucratic procedures. With automation and reduction of intermediaries, the role of the government does not decrease but significantly changes, i.e. land cadaster bodies should not be monopolistic providers on the market. The paper introduces a theoretical basis for developing a new type of property registries.

abstract = {Illicit crypto-mining leverages resources stolen from victims to mine cryptocurrencies on behalf of criminals. While recent works have analyzed one side of this threat, i.e.: web-browser cryptojacking, only commercial reports have partially covered binary-based crypto-mining malware. In this paper, we conduct the largest measurement of crypto-mining malware to date, analyzing approximately 4.5 million malware samples (1.2 million malicious miners), over a period of twelve years from 2007 to 2019. Our analysis pipeline applies both static and dynamic analysis to extract information from the samples, such as wallet identifiers and mining pools. Together with OSINT data, this information is used to group samples into campaigns. We then analyze publicly-available payments sent to the wallets from mining-pools as a reward for mining, and estimate profits for the different campaigns. All this together is is done in a fully automated fashion, which enables us to leverage measurement-based findings of illicit crypto-mining at scale. Our profit analysis reveals campaigns with multi-million earnings, associating over 4.4% of Monero with illicit mining. We analyze the infrastructure related with the different campaigns, showing that a high proportion of this ecosystem is supported by underground economies such as Pay-Per-Install services. We also uncover novel techniques that allow criminals to run successful campaigns.},

abstract = {Bit coin is a decentralized P2P digital currency in which coins are generated by a distributed set of miners and transactions are broadcasted via a peer-to-peer network. While Bit coin provides some level of anonymity (or rather pseudonymity) by encouraging the users to have any number of random-looking Bit coin addresses, recent research shows that this level of anonymity is rather low. This encourages users to connect to the Bit coin network through anonymizers like Tor and motivates development of default Tor functionality for popular mobile SPV clients. In this paper we show that combining Tor and Bit coin creates a new attack vector. A low-resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use Bit coin over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together user's transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which Bit coin blocks and transactions are relayed to user and can delay or discard user's transactions and blocks. Moreover, we show how an attacker can fingerprint users and then recognize them and learn their IP addresses when they decide to connect to the Bit coin network directly.},

Present econophysics models are usually employed on presumed random networks of interacting agents, and only some macroscopic properties (e.g. the resulting wealth distribution) are compared to real-world data. In this paper, we analyze Bitcoin, which is a novel digital currency system, where the complete list of transactions is publicly available. Using this dataset, we reconstruct the network of transactions and extract the time and amount of each payment. We analyze the structure of the transaction network by measuring network characteristics over time, such as the degree distribution, degree correlations and clustering. We find that linear preferential attachment drives the growth of the network. We also study the dynamics taking place on the transaction network, i.e. the flow of money. We measure temporal patterns and the wealth accumulation. Investigating the microscopic statistics of money movement, we find that sublinear preferential attachment governs the evolution of the wealth distribution. We report a scaling law between the degree and wealth associated to individual nodes.},

Introduction The Advent of Blockchain Much has been said recently about Bitcoin, blockchains and distributed ledger technologies (DLT). The legendary Satoshi Nakamoto is given credit for instigating these 2 discussions. In this research, we refer to Nakamoto's seminal paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" (2008) to apply his proposed characteristics to the accounting systems domain. We find that the requirements are that the system must be peer-to-peer (no trusted third party), transactions are publicly announced, there is a single history of the order of the transactions, there is a time-stamp server, and there needs to be a system of proof-of-work. The foundation of bitcoin is that of DLT, or more precisely, blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger of transactions in which all participants can log, view, monitor, and approve an identical common copy in a real-time basis. Since it is decentralized, the ledger is not owned by any one business or participant, nor is it monitored and regulated by a trusted third party. Instead, these functions are distributed among all participants. Any changes must be approved by a majority of participants and once recorded, a transaction or input cannot be altered or destroyed. The fact that a blockchain can be observed and any new entries confirmed by many diverse participants simultaneously purportedly reduces the risk of security breaches and fraud. Politically, blockchain could be regarded as a pure form of democracy, in that all participants are granted equal rights of observation and approval, and it is the consensus of the parties that legitimizes a transaction. Blockchain provides a means for many different participants, regardless of location, to record their transactions in a jointly shared "master" digital ledger that exists as linked and synchronized copies in their respective computers. Every transaction is time stamped at different intervals and linked to the previous event via a cryptographic hash. Instead of keeping separate records based on receipts and vouchers, participants can enter their transactions directly into the shared blockchain ledger. This entry, once confirmed by a consensus of the participants, is then cryptographically locked and almost impossible to alter. These blockchain features of consensus approval of transactions and of the immutability of records could potentially render the double entry accounting system outdated and irrelevant. Accounting records are examined by external auditors on behalf of investors to provide reasonable assurance as to their accuracy and integrity and to ensure compliance with accounting regulations. These examinations can be lengthy and laborious, often requiring manual reviews and obtaining paper documentation. Blockchain should be able to reduce this reliance on manual tasks and duplication of records, as has been recently demonstrated by Deloitte (2017). Deloitte states that "Every transaction becomes 'notarized'" (Bacani 2017). Technology and automation are accelerating auditing processes. When businesses can record their transactions directly to a shared blockchain that is synchronized on a real-time basis with other participants either internal or external to the business, the requirement for double entry accounting goes away (Dai and Vasarhelyi 2017). In theory, financial statements, budgets, benchmarks, and forecasts can be generated on real time, on demand basis. The processes of generating and examining annual financial statements become irrelevant. 3 However, the integration of blockchain within the auditing process will most likely be one of gradual adoption and not a large-scale disruption. As a first step to illustrate, we take the design requirements for a blockchain and using Design Science Research (DSR), we consider the possible accounting systems which match those requirements. We then consider the issues of data reliability, data security and transaction transparency in those classes of accounting systems which lend themselves to a blockchain or distributed ledger solution approach using DSR as our criteria (Hevner et al 2004, Peffers et al 2008). This DSR approach for blockchain and DLT is then viewed from the aspect of designing auditable systems (Alles et al 2008, Appelbaum and Nehmer 2017). We discuss transactions, contracts and and workflows for classes of viable accounting systems in this context.. After this, we consider how auditors would go about providing assurance on systems which have these characteristics. We consider how DLT technologies pertain to the evidence standards of both internal and external auditors. We also consider how such systems would affect confirmations. We also provide a proof of concept using a cloud computing environment. Finally, we consider the challenges that DLTs pose for both accounting and auditing and suggest some avenues for future research. Throughout our discussion, we assume that an adequate system of governance and control is already in place for both the business and for IT. Our discussion is meant to be incremental in character. Methodology The methodology used in this paper is design science research (DSR). The paper follows the DSR approach introduced by Hevner et al. (2004) and Peffers et al. (2007). Other AIS research using the DSR approach include Geerts (2011), Nehmer and Srivastava (2016) and Appelbaum and Nehmer (2017). This paper uses Geerts (2011) application of DSR which categorizes the methodology into six major activities. The six activities are: 1. Problem identification and motivation 2. Define the objectives of a solution 3. Design and development of an artifact which meets (some of) the solution objectives 4. Demonstration of the solution 5. Evaluation of the solution 6. Communication of the problem and the solution (usually an article)},

abstract = {In recent years, blockchain technology has received unparalleled attention from academia, industry, and governments all around the world. It is considered a technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many ways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain performs the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus algorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on the properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain consensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by analysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy of properties and by examining the implications of different issues still prevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is presented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these algorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to understand their properties and to implicate different trends in these crypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to be used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under different criteria.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

Without "physical delivery," strategies based on "corners" or "squeezes" are infeasible. However, uninformed investors still earn positive expected profits by establishing a futures position and then trading in the spot market to manipulate the spot price used to compute the cash settlement at delivery. We also show that as the number of manipulators grows, profits from manipulation fall to zero. However, even in the limit, manipulation still has a nontrivial impact on market liquidity. More broadly, we interpret manipulation as a form of endogenous "noise trading" which can arise in multiperiod security markets.},

To solve this problem, we propose overall performance metrics and detailed performance metrics for the users to know the exact performance in different stages of the blockchain. Then we propose a performance monitoring framework with a log-based method. It has advantages of lower overhead, more details, and better scalability than the previous performance monitoring approaches. Finally we implement the framework to monitor four well-known blockchain systems, using a set of 1,000 open-source smart contracts. The experimental results show that our framework can make detailed and real-time performance monitoring of blockchain systems.

Blockchain technology promises to overcome security challenges in IoT enabled services such as enabling secure data sharing and data integrity. However, it also introduces new security challenges that should be investigated and tackled. In this paper, we review the literature to identify the potential use cases and application of Blockchain to enable government services. We also synthesized literature related to the security of Blockchain implementations to identify the security benefits, challenges and the proposed solutions. The analysis shows that is huge potential for Blockchain technology to be used in to enable smart government services.

abstract = {Bitcoins and Blockchain technologies are attracting the attention of different scientific communities. In addition, their widespread industrial applications and the continuous introduction of cryptocurrencies are also stimulating the attention of the public opinion. The underlying structure of these technologies constitutes one of their core concepts. In particular, they are based on peer-to-peer networks. Accordingly, all nodes lie at the same level, so that there is no place for privileged actors as, for instance, banking institutions in classical financial networks. In this work, we perform a preliminary investigation on two kinds of network, i.e. The Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin Cash network. Notably, we analyze their global structure and we try to evaluate if they are provided with a small-world behavior. Results suggest that the principle known as 'fittest-gets-richer', combined with a continuous increasing of connections, might constitute the mechanism leading these networks to reach their current structure. Moreover, further observations open the way to new investigations into this direction.},

abstract = {In an initial coin offering (ICO), new ventures raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on blockchain technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised exploded in 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, the blockchain sector is in its early stages, and little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. In this initial study, I therefore assess ICO's success factors by empirically exploring the capital raised in 238 ICOs in 2016 and 2017. The results show that several characteristics of the ICO campaign and the underlying technology determine the amount raised, while the venture characteristics are less important to investors. While some dynamics resemble those in the context of venture capital or crowdfunding, others are unique to the context of blockchain technology and have not been assessed before. Further analyses explore the duration of ICO campaigns as well as the language used in documents accompanying the ICO. The findings have important implications for theory and practice. For example, they inform policy makers about potential starting points for the introduction of ICO regulation.},

We brieey review Hochreiter's 1991 analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, eecient, gradient-based method called \Long Short-Term Memory" (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error ow through \constant error carrousels" within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error ow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artiicial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with RTRL, BPTT, Recurrent Cascade-Correlation, Elman nets, and Neural Sequence Chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain community, mainly due to the fact that it is designed in a way that enables developers to write smart contract and decentralized applications (Dapps). This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not received much attention; several Ethereum smart contracts malfunctioning have recently been reported. Unlike many previous works that have applied static and dynamic analyses to find bugs in smart contracts, we do not attempt to define and extract any features; instead we focus on reducing the expert's labor costs. We first present a new in-depth analysis of potential attacks methodology and then translate the bytecode of solidity into RGB color code. After that, we transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. Finally, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, detecting compiler bugs of Ethereum smart contract.},

@article{Song2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Ensemble predictors such as the random forest are known to have superior accuracy but their black-box predictions are difficult to interpret. In contrast, a generalized linear model (GLM) is very interpretable especially when forward feature selection is used to construct the model. However, forward feature selection tends to overfit the data and leads to low predictive accuracy. Therefore, it remains an important research goal to combine the advantages of ensemble predictors (high accuracy) with the advantages of forward regression modeling (interpretability). To address this goal several articles have explored GLM based ensemble predictors. Since limited evaluations suggested that these ensemble predictors were less accurate than alternative predictors, they have found little attention in the literature. RESULTS Comprehensive evaluations involving hundreds of genomic data sets, the UCI machine learning benchmark data, and simulations are used to give GLM based ensemble predictors a new and careful look. A novel bootstrap aggregated (bagged) GLM predictor that incorporates several elements of randomness and instability (random subspace method, optional interaction terms, forward variable selection) often outperforms a host of alternative prediction methods including random forests and penalized regression models (ridge regression, elastic net, lasso). This random generalized linear model (RGLM) predictor provides variable importance measures that can be used to define a "thinned" ensemble predictor (involving few features) that retains excellent predictive accuracy. CONCLUSION RGLM is a state of the art predictor that shares the advantages of a random forest (excellent predictive accuracy, feature importance measures, out-of-bag estimates of accuracy) with those of a forward selected generalized linear model (interpretability). These methods are implemented in the freely available R software package randomGLM.},

First, we manually examine 1,108 bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs. Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports, and obtain ten bug categories in blockchain systems. We further investigate the frequency distribution of bug categories across projects and programming languages. Finally, we study the relationship between bug categories and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic bugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency distributions of bug types show similar trends across different projects and programming languages; (3) security bugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4) 35.71% performance bugs are fixed in more than one year; performance bugs take the longest average time to be fixed.},

Despite its increasing relevance in the financial world, a comprehensive analysis of the whole system is still lacking, as most studies have focused exclusively on the behaviour of one (Bitcoin) or few cryptocurrencies. Here, we consider the history of the entire market and analyse the behaviour of 1469 cryptocurrencies introduced between April 2013 and May 2017. We reveal that, while new cryptocurrencies appear and disappear continuously and their market capitalization is increasing (super-)exponentially, several statistical properties of the market have been stable for years. These include the number of active cryptocurrencies, market share distribution and the turnover of cryptocurrencies. Adopting an ecological perspective, we show that the so-called neutral model of evolution is able to reproduce a number of key empirical observations, despite its simplicity and the assumption of no selective advantage of one cryptocurrency over another. Our results shed light on the properties of the cryptocurrency market and establish a first formal link between ecological modelling and the study of this growing system.

abstract = {Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, the execution of an Ethereum smart contract is restricted by a gas limit: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from trivial. In this paper, we classify and identify gas-focused vulnerabilities, and present MadMax: a static program analysis technique to automatically detect gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. Our approach combines a control-flow-analysis-based decompiler and declarative program-structure queries. The combined analysis captures high-level domain-specific concepts (such as “dynamic data structure storage” and “safely resumable loops”) and achieves high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart contracts in the current Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours (with decompilation timeouts in 8% of the cases) and flags contracts with a current (though highly volatile) monetary value of over $5B as vulnerable. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that 81% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities, which we report on in our experiment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we gather together the minimum units of Bitcoin identity (the individual addresses), and group them into approximations of business entities, what we call “super clusters”. While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, we are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns, as observed during the period from 2009-2015. We are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. We conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e., gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises.},

abstract = {Goats have always been considered very useful animals. Goats success is related to its excellent adaptability to the diicult mountain conditions, extreme weather and low value feed acceptance, versatile habits and high production considering their size. These are some reasons because goats are among the irst animals to be domesticated. In terms of evolution, goats could be separated by their dispersion area in three large groups: the European, the Asian, and the African. Global goat populations, mainly in Africa and in Asia, have increased for centuries but very strongly in the past decades, well above the world population growth. They are also used for forest grazing, an integrated and alter- native production system, very useful to control weed growth reducing ire risk. Despite some exceptions, no large‐scale efort to professionalize this industry has been made so far. There are consumers for goat dairy products and there is enough global production, but misses a professional network between both. Regarding goat meat, the world leader- ship also stays in Africa and Asia, namely in China, and there is a new phenomenon, the spreading of goat meat tradition through Europe due to migrants from Africa and other places with strong goat meat consumption.},

Which approach is better is an empirical matter: in theory, iterated forecasts are more efficient if the one-period ahead model is correctly specified, but direct forecasts are more robust to model misspecification. This paper compares empirical iterated and direct forecasts from linear univariate and bivariate models by applying simulated out-of-sample methods to 170 U.S. monthly macroeconomic time series spanning 1959–2002. The iterated forecasts typically outperform the direct forecasts, particularly, if the models can select long-lag specifications. The relative performance of the iterated forecasts improves with the forecast horizon.},

While it has engendered both widespread antipathy and a multi-billion dollar anti-spam industry, it continues to exist because it fuels a profitable enterprise. We lack, however, a solid understanding of this enterprise's full structure, and thus most anti-spam interventions focus on only one facet of the overall spam value chain (e.g., spam filtering, URL blacklisting, site takedown). In this paper we present a holistic analysis that quantifies the full set of resources employed to monetize spam email-including naming, hosting, payment and fulfillment-using extensive measurements of three months of diverse spam data, broad crawling of naming and hosting infrastructures, and over 100 purchases from spam-advertised sites. We relate these resources to the organizations who administer them and then use this data to characterize the relative prospects for defensive interventions at each link in the spam value chain. In particular, we provide the first strong evidence of payment bottlenecks in the spam value chain; 95% of spam-advertised pharmaceutical, replica and software products are monetized using merchant services from just a handful of banks.},

TumbleBit's anonymity properties are similar to classic Chaumian eCash: no one, not even the Tumbler, can link a payment from its payer to its payee. Every payment made via TumbleBit is backed by bitcoins, and comes with a guarantee that Tumbler can neither violate anonymity, nor steal bitcoins, nor " print money " by issuing payments to itself. We prove the security of TumbleBit using the real/ideal world paradigm and the random oracle model. Security follows from the standard RSA assumption and ECDSA unforgeability. We implement TumbleBit, mix payments from 800 users and show that TumbleBit's off-blockchain payments can complete in seconds.},

In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%, 90.1% and 80% contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper aims to identify the likely determinants for cryptocurrency value formation, including for that of bitcoin. Due to Bitcoin's growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance, it has become increasingly important to try to understand the factors that influence its value formation. Presently, the value of all bitcoins in existence represent approximately $7 billion, and more than $60 million of notional value changes hands each day. Having grown rapidly over the past few years, there is now a developing but vibrant marketplace for bitcoin, and a recognition of digital currencies as an emerging asset class. Not only is there a listed and over-the-counter market for bitcoin and other digital currencies, but also an emergent derivatives market. As such, the ability to value bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies is becoming critical to its establishment as a legitimate financial asset. Using cross-sectional empirical data examining 66 of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, a regression model was estimated that points to three main drivers of cryptocurrency value: the level of competition in the network of producers, the rate of unit production, and the difficulty of algorithm used to “mine” for the cryptocurrency. These amount to relative differences in the cost of production of one digital currency over another at the margin, pointing to differences in relative cost of production – electricity goes in, cryptocurrency comes out. Using that as a starting point, a no-arbitrage situation is established for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies followed by the formalization of a cost of production model to determine the fair value of a bitcoin.},

There is currently limited documented knowledge of factors which could indicate future price movements. This paper aims to decipher relationships between cryptocurrency price changes and topic discussion on social media to provide, among other things, an understanding of which topics are indicative of future price movements. To achieve this a well-known dynamic topic modelling approach is applied to social media communication to retrieve information about the temporal occurrence of various topics. A Hawkes model is then applied to find interactions between topics and cryptocurrency prices. The results show particular topics tend to precede certain types of price movements, for example the discussion of 'risk and investment vs trading' being indicative of price falls, the discussion of 'substantial price movements' being indicative of volatility, and the discussion of 'fundamental cryptocurrency value' by technical communities being indicative of price rises. The knowledge of topic relationships gained here could be built into a real-time system, providing trading or alerting signals.},

Our solution sports analogous improvements over the lattice adaption of Stern's scheme which Kawachi et al. presented at ASIACRYPT 2008. Specifically, due to a smaller cheating probability close to 1/2 and a similar communication cost, any desired level of security will be achieved in fewer rounds. Compared to Lyubashevsky's scheme presented at ASIACRYPT 2009, our proposal, like Kawachi's, offers a much milder security assumption: namely, the hardness of SIS for trinary solutions. The same assumption was used for the SWIFFT hash function, which is secure for much smaller parameters than those proposed by Lyubashevsky. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {► The total amount of funds raised via ICOs is approaching US$4 billion, twice the volume of venture capital (VC) investments in blockchain projects. Since late 2017, the ICO volume has been slowing down, and fewer projects are reaching fundraising goals. ► ICO investors are buying tokens, which are, in most cases, a means of payment on a blockchain platform. The platform itself is usually in the development stage at the time of the ICO, and the token contains a minimum of the issuer's obligations. ► The need for a blockchain and token is often unjustified. The most successful projects are within a blockchain infrastructure, and the most successful platform is Ethereum. ► Because most ICOs use the Ethereum platform, it has led to an overloaded network and an increase in Ether price, which has led to an increase in ICO costs. Terms and functionality of the token are defined in smart contracts with program code that can contain errors or latent terms. ► ICO valuation is often based on “fear of missing out” instead of project development forecasts and the nature of token. A lack of fundamental valuation leads to extreme token price volatility in post-ICO trading. ► The volume of ICOs draws hackers' attention. More than 10% of ICO proceeds are lost as a result of attacks. In addition to losing funds and increasing project risk, investor personal data is at risk of being exposed. ► Most regulators are moving from ignoring ICOs to banning them or regulating them by existing laws in accordance with the nature of the token. Meanwhile, market players are developing self-regulation. One of the most interesting initiatives is the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT). ► ICOs have become synonymous with hype and excessive risk, yet they can actually help protect investors. The future of ICOs will be determined by the transparency of blockchain technology and the ability to set new standards that are accepted by all participants.},

From the results, it is found that that the correlation follows an aperiodic cyclical nature, and the crypto-currency prices are driven by Bitcoin price movements. Based on the results obtained, we suggest that constructing a portfolio based on crypto-currencies may be risky at this point of time as the other crypto-currency prices are mainly driven by Bitcoin prices, and any shocks in the latter is immediately transformed to the former.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

abstract = {Being a new kind of software leveraging blockchain to execute real contracts, smart contracts are in great demand due to many advantages. Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform that supports smart contracts by running them in its virtual machine. To ensure that a smart contract will terminate eventually and prevent abuse of resources, Ethereum charges the developers for deploying smart contracts and the users for executing smart contracts. Although our previous work shows that under-optimized smart contracts may cost more money than necessary, it just lists 7 anti-patterns and the detection method for 3 of them. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth investigation on such under-optimized smart contracts. We first identify 24 anti-patterns from the execution traces of real smart contracts. Then, we design and develop GasReducer, the first tool to automatically detect all these anti-patterns from the bytecode of smart contracts and replace them with efficient code through bytecode-to-bytecode optimization. Using GasReducer to analyze all smart contracts and their execution traces, we detect 9,490,768 and 557,565,754 anti-pattern instances in deploying and invoking smart contracts, respectively.},

Because of Bitcoin's success, many modern cryptocurrencies are simply variations on the Bitcoin framework. These Bitcoin derivatives are referred to as Altcoins. By understanding the cryptocurrency framework, through analysis of Bitcoin, examiners will be capable of understanding artifacts in a wide range of cryptocurrencies. In this chapter, we learn Bitcoin through example by first understanding the underlying theory and then seeing it in action. By using the MultiBit HD client, we observe transactions coming across the wire and look for their network and disk-based artifacts. From this approach we accomplish two things: the reader obtains a technical understanding of how cryptocurrencies work and how to forensically analyze and evaluate cryptocurrency artifacts.},

We use a VAR modelling approach, upon which the Geweke's feedback measures and generalized impulse response functions are computed. This methodology allows us to fully characterize the direction, intensity and persistence of information flows between cryptocurrencies. At this data granularity, most of information transmission is contemporaneous. However, it seems that there are some lagged feedback effects, mainly from other cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin. The generalized impulse-response functions confirm that there is a strong contemporaneous correlation and that there is not much evidence of lagged effects. The exception appears to be related to the overreaction of Bitcoin returns to contemporaneous shocks.},

abstract = {Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a new and unregulated form of crowdfunding that raises funds through a blockchain by selling venture-related tokens or coins in exchange for legal tender or cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we establish token or coin tradability as the primary ICO success measure, and we develop a theoretical framework for how venture uncertainty, venture quality, and investor opportunity set interrelate. We use the largest available dataset to date, consisting of 1,009 ICOs from 2015 to March 2018. Our data highlights that venture uncertainty (not being on Github and Telegram, shorter whitepapers, higher percentage of tokens distributed) is negatively correlated, while higher venture quality (better connected CEOs and larger team size) is positively correlated, with ICO success. Moreover, providing a hard cap in a pre-ICO can help investors measure success in the pre-sale. This is another positive signal of funding success.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 ACM. Efficient concurrent programs and data structures rarely employ coarse-grained synchronization mechanisms (i.e., locks); instead, they implement custom synchronization patterns via fine-grained primitives, such as compare-and-swap. Due to sophisticated interference scenarios between threads, reasoning about such programs is challenging and error-prone, and can benefit from mechanization. In this paper, we present the first completely formalized framework for mechanized verification of full functional correctness of fine-grained concurrent programs. Our tool is based on the recently proposed program logic FCSL. It is implemented as an embedded domain-specific language in the dependently-typed language of the Coq proof assistant, and is powerful enough to reason about programming features such as higher-order functions and local thread spawning. By incorporating a uniform concurrency model, based on state-transition systems and partial commutative monoids, FCSL makes it possible to build proofs about concurrent libraries in a thread-local, compositional way, thus facilitating scalability and reuse: libraries are verified just once, and their specifi-cations are used ubiquitously in client-side reasoning. We illustrate the proof layout in FCSL by example, and report on our experience of using FCSL to verify a number of concurrent programs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2018. The recent growth of the blockchain technology market puts its main cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. Among them, Ethereum stands out due to its virtual machine (EVM) supporting smart contracts, i.e., distributed programs that control the flow of the digital currency Ether. Being written in a Turing complete language, Ethereum smart contracts allow for expressing a broad spectrum of financial applications. The price for this expressiveness, however, is a significant semantic complexity, which increases the risk of programming errors. Recent attacks exploiting bugs in smart contract implementations call for the design of formal verification techniques for smart contracts. This, however, requires rigorous semantic foundations, a formal characterization of the expected security properties, and dedicated abstraction techniques tailored to the specific EVM semantics. This work will overview the state-of-the-art in smart contract verification, covering formal semantics, security definitions, and verification tools. We will then focus on EtherTrust [1], a framework for the static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts which includes the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, the first formal characterization of a large class of security properties for smart contracts, and the first static analysis for EVM bytecode that comes with a proof of soundness.},

This observation not only applies to conventional political constitutions, but to the fundamental rules which govern interactions by numerous people using new forms of technology. Blockchain technology aims to coordinate action in a world of incomplete information and opportunism, but the governance arrangements in blockchain protocols remain far from settled. Drawing upon recent theoretical developments regarding constitutional change, we interpret changes to the fundamental working rules of blockchain protocols as central to the adaptive, emergent nature of activity within this technological space. We apply this concept of "constitutional catallaxy" to selected blockchain platform case studies, illustrating the dynamism inherent in establishing protocols within the blockchain. Blockchain coordination changes and adapts not only to the technological limitations of the available protocols, but to mutual expectations and influence of interacting stakeholders.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a cryptocurrency framework that uses blockchain technology to provide an open distributed computing plat-form, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM programs are written in bytecode which operates on a sim-ple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like lan-guage called Solidity that compiles to bytecode. Since the main application of EVM programs is as smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets, security is of paramount importance. However, writing trustworthy smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to the intricate semantics of EVM and its openness: both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs. This problem is best illustrated by the recent attack on TheDAO contract, which allowed roughly $50M USD worth of Ether to be transferred into the control of an attacker. Re-covering the funds required a hard fork of the blockchain, contrary to the code is law premise of the system. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Solidity contracts in F , a functional programming language aimed at program verification.},

Our protocols are based on a tournament bracket construction, and require only $O(\backslashlog N)$ rounds. Our lottery protocols thus represent a significant improvement, both because they allow players with little money to participate, and because of the time value of money. The Ethereum-based implementation of our lottery is highly efficient. The Bitcoin implementation requires an $O(2^N)$ off-chain setup phase, which demonstrates that the expressive power of the scripting language can have important implications.

While it has become increasingly clear that nominal price levels influence investor behavior, why prices matter to investors is a question that as of yet has gone unanswered. We find widespread evidence that investors systematically overestimate the skewness of low-priced stocks. In the broad cross-section of stocks, we find that investors substantially overweight the importance of price when forming skewness expectations. Asset pricing implications of our findings are borne out in the options market. A zero-cost option portfolio strategy that exploits investor overestimation of skewness for low-priced stocks generates significant abnormal returns. Finally, investor expectations of future skewness increase drastically on days that a stock undergoes a split to a lower nominal price. Empirically, however, future physical skewness decreases following splits.},

abstract = {The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a virtual machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level byte-code to detect potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the Souffl{\'{e}} language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common smart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95% of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools-Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle-under equivalent conditions .},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has a wide range of applications in the fields of finance, credit reporting and intellectual property, etc. As the core of blockchain, consensus algorithm affects the security and performance of blockchain system directly. In the past 10 years, there have been about 30 consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA) and AlgoRand. But their security, stability and operating efficiency still lag far behind our actual needs. This paper introduces the computing power competition of PoW into DPoS to design an improved consensus algorithm named Delegated Proof of Stake with Downgrade (DDPoS). Through the further modification, the impact of both computing resources and stakes on generating blocks is reduced to achieve higher efficiency, fairness, and decentralization in consensus process. Then a downgrade mechanism is proposed to quickly replace the malicious nodes to improve the security. The simulation experiments in blockchain system show that the proposed consensus algorithm is significantly more efficient than PoW and PoS, but slightly lower than DPoS. However, its degree of centralization remains far below that of DPoS. And through the downgrade mechanism, the proposed consensus algorithm can detect and downgrade the malicious nodes timely to ensure the security and good operation of system.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has been developed for more than ten years and has become a trend in various industries. As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.},

abstract = {The amount of available content on the Internet vastly outweighs the attention span of online users. In the last few years, crowdsourced content curation has emerged as a novel approach to the aggregation and filtering of content in social media platforms. As opposed to traditional curation techniques, it avoids the reliance on a central party to curate content, allowing online communities to self-regulate. The advent of blockchains and cryptocurrencies has created new ways for the distribution and ownership of financial value over the Internet. Steemit is a social media platform which establishes financial rewards for the crowdsourced curation of content using the cryptocurrencies of the Steem blockchain. In this work we present an analysis of the Steem blockchain, focusing on the economic and incentives model of the platform. Then we identify and evaluate the main issues of the incentives model of Steemit. Namely, we analyze the self-voting pattern and voting rings, moderation and censorship abuse in Steemit, and the types of voting bots in the platform. To better understand how self-voting can affect financially incentivized crowdsourced curation, we construct a formal model inspired by Steemit. Our model provides a formal framework which may be used in the evaluation of the incentive compatibility of Steemit or other decentralized content curation systems with monetary rewards. To conclude, we design and implement a solution for the moderation and censorship issues of Steemit in the form of a smart contract.},

abstract = {We rely on economic theory to discuss how blockchain technology will shape the rate and direction of innovation. We identify two key costs affected by the technology: 1) the cost of verification; and 2) the cost of networking. The first cost relates to the ability to cheaply verify the attributes of a transaction. The second one to the ability to bootstrap and operate a marketplace without the need for a traditional intermediary: When combined with a native token (as in Bitcoin and Ethereum), a blockchain allows a decentralized network of economic agents to agree, at regular intervals , about the true state of shared data. This shared data can represent exchanges of currency, intellectual property, equity, information or other types of contracts and digital assets-making blockchain a general purpose technology that can be used to trade scarce, digital property rights and create novel types of digital platforms. The resulting marketplaces are characterized by increased competition, lower barriers to entry and innovation, lower privacy and censorship risk, and allow participants within the same ecosystem to make investments to support and operate shared infrastructure without assigning market power to a platform operator. They also challenge the existing revenue models and accumulated knowledge and resources of incumbents, and open opportunities for new approaches to startup fundraising, the provision of public goods and software protocols, data ownership and licensing, auctions and reputation systems.},

The model deployed has much in common with the modern 'endogenous money' school initiated by Kaldor which emphasises the essential role played by credit in any real life economy, since production takes time and the future is always uncertain. New ground is broken methodologically because all the propositions are justified by simulations of a rigorous (60-equation) model, making it possible to pin down exactly why the results come out as they do. One conclusion of the paper is that there is no such thing as a supply of money distinct from the money which agents wish to hold, or find themselves holding. This finding is inimical, possibly in the end lethal, to the way macroeconomics is currently taught as well as to the neoclassical paradigm itself.},

@unpublished{Kiayias2016Speed-SecurityProtocols,
abstract = {Transaction processing speed is one of the major considerations in cryptocurrencies that are based on proof of work (POW) such as Bitcoin. At an intuitive level it is widely understood that processing speed is at odds with the security aspects of the underlying POW based consensus mechanism of such protocols, nevertheless the tradeo between the two properties is still not well understood. In this work, motivated by recent work [8] in the formal analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol, we investigate the tradeo between provable security and transaction processing speed viewing the latter as a function of the block generation rate. We introduce a new formal property of blockchain protocols, called chain growth, and we show it is fundamental for arguing the security of a robust transaction ledger. We strengthen the results of [8] in the following ways: we show how the properties of persistence and liveness of the ledger reduce in a black-box fashion in the underlying properties of the backbone protocol, namely common prex, chain quality and chain growth, and we improve the security bounds showing that the robustness of the ledger holds for even the faster (than Bitcoin's) block generation rates which have been adopted by other alt-coins. We also present a theoretical attack against bitcoin which we validate in simulation that works when blockchain rate is highly accelerated. This presents a natural upper bound in the context of the speed-security tradeo. By combining our positive and negative results we map the speed/security domain for blockchain protocols and list open problems for future work.},

abstract = {Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies are rapidly evolving and gaining terrain in today's economy. However, legislators in the United States and abroad are still assessing the legal status of cryptocurrencies and often pursuing quite different approaches in their regulation. On the other hand, the blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin transactions, offers itself as a great tool that should be implemented in the corporate governance field because of its recording certainty features. The blockchain, through the distributed ledger, allows users within a network to consume peer-to-peer digital transactions while accessing and monitoring changes in the ledger as they occur. The ledger also offers an opportunity to maintain information secure by encrypting and allowing access only to holders of cryptographic «keys>. Because of its lack of a centralized issuer and absence of securities deriving from a national apparatus and definite legislation, Bitcoin presents a series of uncertainties that prevent implementation as a corporate governance tool. Instead, the blockchain's capacity to maintain confidential information such as corporate strategies to be voted by board of directors of shareholders secret within a network of allowed users and to record transactions or events with certainty should be explored and implemented in the corporate field.

@article{Granger1987,
abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series xt first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination ?′??$\alpha$′xt\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t} is already stationary, the time series xt are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector $\alpha$. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that $\alpha$ becomes a matrix. Interpreting ?′??=0$\alpha$′xt=0\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}=0 as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

abstract = {Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners. Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics. This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and "discovering" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently. Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three concurrent threads.},

abstract = {Blockchains, and specifically smart contracts, have promised to create fair and transparent trading ecosystems. Unfortunately, we show that this promise has not been met. We document and quantify the widespread and rising deployment of arbitrage bots in blockchain systems, specifically in decentralized exchanges (or "DEXes"). Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in DEXes, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun, i.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users' DEX trades. We study the breadth of DEX arbitrage bots in a subset of transactions that yield quantifiable revenue to these bots. We also study bots' profit-making strategies, with a focus on blockchain-specific elements. We observe bots engage in what we call priority gas auctions (PGAs), competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions. PGAs present an interesting and complex new continuous-time, partial-information, game-theoretic model that we formalize and study. We release an interactive web portal, http://frontrun.me/, to provide the community with real-time data on PGAs. We additionally show that high fees paid for priority transaction ordering poses a systemic risk to consensus-layer security. We explain that such fees are just one form of a general phenomenon in DEXes and beyond---what we call miner extractable value (MEV)---that poses concrete, measurable, consensus-layer security risks. We show empirically that MEV poses a realistic threat to Ethereum today. Our work highlights the large, complex risks created by transaction-ordering dependencies in smart contracts and the ways in which traditional forms of financial-market exploitation are adapting to and penetrating blockchain economies.},

abstract = {To its proponents, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional currencies. It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.},

abstract = {Why do retail consumers look for P2P financial intermediation? Are internet-based peer-to-peer (P2P) loans a substitute for or a complement to bank loans? In this study we answer these questions by comparing P2P lending with the non-construction consumer credit market in Germany. We show that P2P lending is servicing a slice of the consumer credit market neglected by banks, namely high-risk and small-sized loans. Nevertheless, when accounting for the risk differential, interest rates are very similar. Our conclusion is that P2P lending is substituting the banking sector for high-risk consumer loans since banks are unwilling or unable to supply this slice of the market. Our study serves to show where the institutionalization of credit provision has left a slice of the market unsupplied.},

To address this lack of awareness, blockchain technology can be implemented in supply chains to increase customers' knowledge of products' provenance. Provenance knowledge—information about products' origin, production, modifications, and custody—enables customers to be assured of their purchasing decisions. This assurance comes from information on the origin, authenticity, custody, and integrity of the product that helps reduce risk perceptions. We develop a provenance knowledge framework and show how its application can enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks via the application of blockchain. We present a guide on how to implement blockchain to establish provenance knowledge and close with a kind warning on the importance of demonstrating the value of blockchain to customers.},

The evidence we document, including a significant price run-up before the start of a P&D, implies that significant wealth transfers between potential insiders and outsiders occur. Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, banned P&Ds on November 24, 2017. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we provide causal evidence that P&Ds are detrimental to the liquidity and price of cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, the blockchain, or whatever distributed consensus protocol underlying the cryptocurrency, can only process a limited number of transactions in a given time interval. To address both of these two issues, we propose a methodology that connects the coin minting with the prosperity of a cryptocurrency. Specifically, when there are fewer transactions, any cryptocurrency adopting our methodology will introduce a greater inflation to motivate transactions. Moreover, this methodology provides deflations and turns the currency towards a reserve of value when the network burden is too heavy.},

abstract = {Legislation generally requires public agencies to account for their activity to the public. Among the many duties imposed by legislatures around the world are requirements for transparency in procurement of services, budgeting and presentation of accounts. However, agencies in countries with high corruption problems have trouble complying with the legislation, especially in smaller agencies. Moreover, it is typically infeasible for national auditors to audit all the accounts rendered, and instead, they select a small sample for audit based on their level of risk. Another problem is that the presentation of accounts occurs once a year for all agencies, leading to a seasonal demand with significant lag time between auditing and accounting period. In this study, we present a non-technical framework based on the emerging technology of blockchain that could be a solution to all these concerns. We apply it within the context of Brazilian legislation and the Federal Court of Accounts of Brazil (TCU), although the proposal is applicable across a wide range of countries facing severe corruption.},

The latter two groups were subdivided into those that trained with high and low levels of scene detail. All pilots then transferred to a high-image-fidelity simulation to fly the same route. The transfer results indicated no effect of scene detail and that the active group performed best, the passive group worst, and the map group at an intermediate level. In Experiment 2 the workload of training was increased, and half the participants were required to train with a north-up map. These changes degraded the transfer performance of the active training group relative to the other two. The implications of the results for workload during rehearsal flights and the kinds of geographical knowledge acquired are discussed.},

Moreover, we find that the S&P 500 volatility risk premium has a significantly positive effect on long-term Bitcoin volatility. Finally, we find a strong positive association between the Baltic dry index and long-term Bitcoin volatility. This result shows that Bitcoin volatility is closely linked to global economic activity.

@article{Saleh2018,
abstract = {A blockchain constitutes a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of agents. Blockchain's value proposition requires that agents eventually agree on the ledger's contents since payments possess risk otherwise. Restricted blockchains ensure this consensus by appointing a central authority to dictate payment validity. Permissionless blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum), however, admit no central authority and therefore face a non-trivial issue of inducing consensus endogenously. Nakamoto (2008) provided a temporary solution to the problem by invoking an economic mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW, however, lacks sustainability, so, in recent years, a variety of alternatives have been proposed. This paper studies the most famous such alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I provide the first formal economic model of PoS and demonstrate that PoS induces consensus in equilibrium. My result arises because I endogenize blockchain coin prices. Propagating disagreement introduces risk and thereby reduces blockchain coin value which implies that stake-holders face an implicit cost from delaying consensus. PoS randomly selects a stake-holder to update the blockchain and provides her an explicit monetary incentive, a “block reward,” for her service. In the event of disagreement, block rewards constitute a perverse incentive, but I demonstrate that restricting updating ability to large stake-holders induces an equilibrium in which consensus obtains as soon as possible. I also demonstrate that consensus obtains eventually almost surely in any equilibrium so long as the blockchain employs a modest block reward schedule. My work reveals the economic viability of permissionless blockchains},

@article{Catania2018,
abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have recently gained a lot of interest from investors, central banks and governments worldwide. The lack of any form of political regu-lation and their market far from being " efficient " , require new forms of regulation in the near future. From an econometric viewpoint, the process underlying the evo-lution of the cryptocurrencies' volatility has been found to exhibit at the same time differences and similarities with other financial time–series, e.g. foreign exchanges returns. This short note focuses on predicting the conditional volatility of the four most traded cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. We investi-gate the effect of accounting for long memory in the volatility process as well as its asymmetric reaction to past values of the series to predict: one day, one and two weeks volatility levels. Many of the stylized facts that characterize usual financial time–series also apply to cryptocurrencies. For instance, similar to equity prices, cryptocurrencies exhibit: i) time–varying volatility, ii) extreme observations, and iii) an asymmetric reaction of the volatility process to the sign of past observations (i.e., leverage effect). However, standard dynamic volatility models like the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model of Bollerslev (1986) do not perform accurately and Catania and Grassi (2017) show that they are outperformed by more refined alternatives like the Score Driven model with conditional Generalized Hyperbolic Skew Student's t (GHSKT) innovations. The specification of the conditional distri-bution of the aforementioned Score Driven volatility model, GHSKT, is important since it characterises the filter for the conditional volatility, see Creal et al. (2013) and Harvey (2013). For instance, Catania and Grassi (2017) find that the robust volatility filter implied by the Score Driven–GHSKT model is of primary impor-tance in describing the stochastic evolution of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, in their analysis involving 289 cryptocurrencies, GARCH is never preferred according to likelihood criteria. The aim of this short note is to extend results of Catania and Grassi (2017) to the important tasks of predicting future volatility levels of the four most representative cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Those cryptocurrencies are the most important in terms of diffusion and market capitalization. At the time of writing market capitalization in USD dollars is 185.5 billion for Bitcoin, 44.3 billion dollars for Ethereum, 9.7 billion dollars for Ripple and 5.5 billion dollars for Litecoin. All together, these cryptocurrencies represent the 73% of the total cryp-tocurrency market value. See Catania and Grassi (2017) for a detailed description of those cryptocurrencies. Since volatility is unobserved and realized volatility measures are not available, in our forecasting analysis we proxy future volatility levels with the square of the re-alized log–returns. Squared returns are known to be a poor volatility proxy, and poor volatility proxies are known to affect forecast comparison, see Andersen and Bollerslev (1998). To lower the influence of a volatility proxy on our results, model comparison is performed using the Quasi–Like (QLIKE) loss function which, as discussed by Patton (2011), is robust to this choice of volatility proxy. Specifically, let $\sigma$ j,t+h|t be the h–step ahead volatility prediction made by model j at time t, and let r t+h the log returns at time t + h, the QLIKE loss is defined as: QLIKE($\sigma$},

To validate the methodology further, a trading strategy is built and tested on historical data. The resulting trading strategy outperforms a buy and hold strategy. The work demonstrates both the broader utility of epidemic-detecting hidden Markov models in the identification of bubble-like behaviour in time series, and that social media can provide valuable predictive information pertaining to cryptocurrency price movements.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either phys- ical commodities or sovereign obligation; instead, it relies on a combination of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer proto- col for witnessing settlements. Consequently, Bitcoin has the un- intuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then us- ing re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this anal- ysis, we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market, the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the chal- lenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.},

abstract = {—Bitcoin is digital assets infrastructure powering the first worldwide decentralized cryptocurrency of the same name. All history of Bitcoins owning and transferring (addresses and transactions) is available as a public ledger called blockchain. But real-world owners of addresses are not known in general. That's why Bitcoin is called pseudo-anonymous. However, some addresses can be grouped by their ownership using behavior pat-terns and publicly available information from off-chain sources. Blockchain-based common behavior pattern analysis (common spending and one-time change heuristics) is widely used for Bitcoin clustering as votes for addresses association, while off-chain information (tags) is mostly used to verify results. In this paper, we propose to use off-chain information as votes for address separation and to consider it together with blockchain information during the clustering model construction step. Both blockchain and off-chain information are not reliable, and our approach aims to filter out errors in input data. The results of the study show the feasibility of a proposed approached for Bitcoin address clustering. It can be useful for the users to avoid insecure Bitcoin usage patterns and for the investigators to conduct a more advanced de-anonymizing analysis.},

Now after 10 years, Bitcoin starts to move gradually from the geek world towards the mass capital markets. Especially in the recent two years, the real value of Bitcoin has been the centre of an increasingly vibrant discussion in the market. Even practitioners and academia are debating on how to value Bitcoin appropriately. With the burst of financial bubbles in 2017 and 2018, the real intrinsic value of Bitcoin is still highly debated. Based on data from July 2016 to December 2018, this research paper aims to explain the relationships between Bitcoin price and its intrinsic value based on the market equilibrium in the mining industry. The model has significantly explanatory power on some recent cryptocurrency events through microeconomics cost analysis method. We concede the needs to consider the endogeneity of the model and will analyse retail trading activities in a subsequent research paper. Secondary},

abstract = {The blockchain could be the most consequential development in information technology since the Internet. Created to support the Bitcoin digital currency, the blockchain is actually something deeper: a novel solution to the age-old human problem of trust. Its potential is extraordinary. Yet, this approach may not promote trust at all without effective governance. Wholly divorced from legal enforcement, blockchain-based systems may be counterproductive or even dangerous. And they are less insulated from the law's reach than it seems. The central question is not how to regulate blockchains but how blockchains regulate. They may supplement, complement, or substitute for legal enforcement. Excessive or premature application of rigid legal obligations will stymie innovation and forego opportunities to leverage technology to achieve public policy objectives. Blockchain developers and legal institutions can work together. Each must recognize the unique affordances of the other system.},

abstract = {We investigate the use of the Hurst exponent, dynamically computed over a weighted moving time-window, to evaluate the level of stability/instability of financial firms. Financial firms bailed-out as a consequence of the 2007–2008 credit crisis show a neat increase with time of the generalized Hurst exponent in the period preceding the unfolding of the crisis. Conversely, firms belonging to other market sectors, which suffered the least throughout the crisis, show opposite behaviors. We find that the multifractality of the bailed-out firms increase at the crisis suggesting that the multi fractal properties of the time series are changing. These findings suggest the possibility of using the scaling behavior as a tool to track the level of stability of a firm. In this paper, we introduce a method to compute the generalized Hurst exponent which assigns larger weights to more recent events with respect to older ones. In this way large fluctuations in the remote past are less likely to influence the recent past. We also investigate the scaling associated with the tails of the log-returns distributions and compare this scaling with the scaling associated with the Hurst exponent, observing that the processes underlying the price dynamics of these firms are truly multi-scaling.},

abstract = {In the evolution of money, the advent of cryptocurrencies would have been an inevitable and a natural phenomenon, but the farfetched implications of the 2008 global credit mayhem only accelerated their arrival. Facebook's claim of the Libra Blockchain as a decentralized network is far from reality, in fact, it is a lie because Libra is designed to be launched in 2020 as a permissioned (centralized) system where billions of transactions will be governed by the 28 heavyweight validator-firms (nodes), each of which is a member of the Libra Association. Facebook has stated that the number of validators will reach 100, when this occurs, each validator including Facebook will have an equal share (i.e. 1%) of voting rights. This is an improvement over the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, not all of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks have voting rights; besides the Fed Chairman and president of the Bank of New York (Vice-Chairman), four of the remaining eleven Reserve Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. Contrary to the huge hype filled with hopes, Bitcoin (as well as other existing 2,300 digital coins) on account of extreme volatility has failed to become a simple global crypto-currency for everyday life, enabling people to transfer money to individuals or businesses anywhere in the world and purchase desired products and services online within seconds without going through unnecessary hassle (i.e. limited or no access) and financial burden of high transactional costs. Facebook's Libra seems to possess all necessary elements to become a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar only if major central banks (particularly the Fed and ECB) and governments allow it.},

@article{Ahmed2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND All methods routinely used to generate safety signals from pharmacovigilance databases rely on disproportionality analyses of counts aggregating patients' spontaneous reports. Recently, it was proposed to analyze individual spontaneous reports directly using Bayesian lasso logistic regressions. Nevertheless, this raises the issue of choosing an adequate regularization parameter in a variable selection framework while accounting for computational constraints due to the high dimension of the data. PURPOSE Our main objective is to propose a method, which exploits the subsampling idea from Stability Selection, a variable selection procedure combining subsampling with a high-dimensional selection algorithm, and adapts it to the specificities of the spontaneous reporting data, the latter being characterized by their large size, their binary nature and their sparsity. MATERIALS AND METHOD Given the large imbalance existing between the presence and absence of a given adverse event, we propose an alternative subsampling scheme to that of Stability Selection resulting in an over-representation of the minority class and a drastic reduction in the number of observations in each subsample. Simulations are used to help define the detection threshold as regards the average proportion of false signals. They are also used to compare the performances of the proposed sampling scheme with that originally proposed for Stability Selection. Finally, we compare the proposed method to the gamma Poisson shrinker, a disproportionality method, and to a lasso logistic regression approach through an empirical study conducted on the French national pharmacovigilance database and two sets of reference signals. RESULTS Simulations show that the proposed sampling strategy performs better in terms of false discoveries and is faster than the equiprobable sampling of Stability Selection. The empirical evaluation illustrates the better performances of the proposed method compared with gamma Poisson shrinker and the lasso in terms of number of reference signals retrieved.},

Through a regression analysis, we ind that coins with more information available and higher levels of technical innovation are associated with higher quality discussion.

Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.},

abstract = {We aim to understand the dynamics of crypto asset prices and, specifically, how price information is transmitted among different bitcoin market exchanges, and between bitcoin markets and traditional ones. To this aim, we hierarchically cluster bitcoin prices from different exchanges, as well as classic assets, by enriching the correlation based minimum spanning tree method with a preliminary filtering method based on the random matrix approach. Our main empirical findings are that: (i) bitcoin exchange prices are positively related with each other and, among them, the largest exchanges, such as Bitstamp, drive the prices; (ii) bitcoin exchange prices are not affected by classic asset prices, but their volatilities are, with a negative and lagged effect.},

abstract = {Ransomware can prevent a user from accessing a device and its files until a ransom is paid to the attacker, most frequently in Bitcoin. With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals and the public. However, a more comprehensive, evidence-based picture on the global direct financial impact of ransomware attacks is still missing. In this paper, we present a data-driven method for identifying and gathering information on Bitcoin transactions related to illicit activity based on footprints left on the public Bitcoin blockchain. We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source platform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35 ransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of each ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for ransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12,768,536 (22,967.54 BTC). We also find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players responsible for the majority of the payments. Based on these research findings, policy-makers and law enforcement agencies can use the statistics provided to understand the size of the illicit market and make informed decisions on how best to address the threat.},

abstract = {Modern distributed data management systems face a new challenge: how can autonomous, mutually-distrusting parties cooperate safely and effectively? Addressing this challenge brings up questions familiar from classical distributed systems: how to combine multiple steps into a single atomic action, how to recover from failures, and how to synchronize concurrent access to data. Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are autonomous and potentially adversarial. We propose the notion of a *cross-chain deal*, a new way to structure complex distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different, in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger.},

abstract = {Exception analysis and points-to analysis are typically done in complete separation. Past algorithms for precise exception anal- ysis (e.g., pairing throw clauses with catch statements) use pre- computed points-to information. Past points-to analyses either un- soundly ignore exceptions, or conservatively compute a crude ap- proximation of exception throwing (e.g., considering an exception throw as an assignment to a global variable, accessible from any catch clause). We show that this separation results in significant slowdowns or vast imprecision. The two kinds of analyses are inter- dependent: neither can be performed accurately without the other. The interdependency leads us to propose a joint handling for per- formance and precision. We show that our exception analysis is expressible highly elegantly in a declarative form, and can apply to points-to analyses of varying precision. In fact, our specification of exception analysis is “fully precise”, as it models closely the Java exception handling semantics. The necessary approximation is pro- vided only through whichever abstractions are used for contexts and objects in the base points-to analysis. Our combined approach achieves similar precision relative to exceptions (exception-catch links) as the best past precise exception analysis, with a runtime of seconds instead of tens of minutes. At the same time, our analysis achieves much higher precision of points-to information (an aver- age of half as many values for each reachable variable for most of the DaCapo benchmarks) than points-to analyses that treat excep- tions conservatively, all at a fraction of the execution time.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34, 200 (2, 365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract. On a subset of 3, 759 contracts which we sampled for concrete validation and manual analysis, we reproduce real exploits at a true positive rate of 89%, yielding exploits for 3, 686 contracts.

abstract = {Mounting deanonymization attacks on the unreachable Bit-coin nodes – these nodes do not accept incoming connections – residing behind the NAT is a challenging task. Such an attack was first given by Biryukov, Khovratovich and Pustogarov based on their observation that a node can be uniquely identified in a single session by their directly-connected neighbouring nodes (ACM CCS'15). However, the BKP15 attack is less effective across multiple sessions. To address this issue, Biryukov and Pustogarov later on devised a new strategy exploiting cer-tain properties of address-cookies (IEEE S&P'15). Unfortunately, the BP15 attack is also rendered ineffective by the present modification to the Bitcoin client. In this paper, we devise an efficient method to link the sessions of un-reachable nodes, even if they connect to the Bitcoin network over the Tor. We achieve this using a new approach based on organizing the block-requests made by the nodes in a Bitcoin session graph. This attack also works against the modified Bitcoin client. We performed experiments on the Bitcoin main network, and were able to link consecutive sessions with a precision of 0.90 and a recall of 0.71. We also provide counter-measures to mitigate the attacks.},

abstract = {The blockchain underlying Bitcoin is moving beyond money and into record keeping and law. This essay explores recent efforts to harness the ledger-like qualities of blockchains to create contracts. Along the way, it considers the forms and functions of other historical examples of ledgers, the dynamics of visibility and publicity, and shifts in the incentive structure of blockchain systems. Distributed, autonomously-executing contracts sound like science fiction. Their non-contractual basis in social relations, cultural assumptions, and human-computer labor, together with their particular system of incentives, may make of contract a kind of game with real-world consequences. Most of the talk about Bitcoin has centered on its potential as a new form of currency, or on the use of the underlying technology as a new electronic value transfer platform or protocol. At the payments industry conference Money20/20 in the autumn of 2013, Bitcoin promoters were declaring that Bitcoin was "like SMTP [an email protocol] for money." It promised a universal protocol allowing different existing payments providers to transfer value using the Bitcoin blockchain to any other endpoint. At the same conference, Bitcoin advocates were stickering the exhibit hall, posting handwritten signs, and passing out leaflets and magazines. By 2014, however, the promise of the protocol seemed to have come to fruition: Bitcoin-based payment providers like BitPay and Coinbase purchased elaborate booths for Money20/20, and had developed professional collateral to advertise their services-and, perhaps more importantly, showed their desire for legitimacy and market dominance alongside traditional payment providers, such as Western Union, Visa, or PayPal. About this same time, however, there were ripples (so to speak) in the Bitcoin universe. New, non-Bitcoin based startups launched, each a little different in terms of the underlying technology and promise. A new company called Ripple put itself forward as an electronic settlement infrastructure, based on distributed consensus in a communications network rather than a distributed blockchain database. It would go on to operate almost like an interbank clearing service, until it was fined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Department of Treasury for operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. i Ripple inherits the ledger technology from Bitcoin but utilizes a network of trusted parties ("validation" nodes), much like the way traditional financial services operate, instead of the computationally expensive and slower mining system of Bitcoin. Additionally, while Bitcoin is a system of currency, Ripple is a system that transfers debt obligations, not money. Other start-ups, Ethereum and Eris, each offered distributed, blockchain-based systems for creating and running applications without a central server or authority as a control point. These services promise a way to use the core qualities of blockchain databases to craft peer-to-peer applications that can be autonomous and self-executing. Ethereum and},

abstract = {We investigated the formation of cocontinuous structures in polymer blends. These polymeric bijels (bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels) were composed of polystyrene oligomer, polybutene and fluorescent hydrophobic silica nanoparticles. A micron-sized cocontinuous morphology was stabilized by a monolayer of silica nanoparticles at the interface. Real-time observation of coalescence dynamics in co-continuous polymer blends stabilized by interfacial particles was for the first time achieved via laser scanning confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that suppression of coalescence arises from coverage of interfaces by nanoparticles. Furthermore, by combining confocal microscopy with rheology, we correlated the rheological response of a cocontinuous structure with its morphology change. We found that the rheological behavior can be attributed to competition between interface shrinkage and particle network formation. In addition, we showed that a particle scaffold is maintained even after the remixing of two polymer phases above the spinodal point. Finally, we also discussed differences between the shear response of the particle-stabilized cocontinuous structure and normal colloidal gels: the former one is more fragile than the latter under shear.},

These trends-transparency, ESG and geopolitical risk, endurance of cycles and disruptive technological change-have been the focus of our CEO roundtables and broader client conversations throughout the year, and no doubt the talk of investment boards the world over. MSCI Real Estate is a long-time champion of transparency. So we start by exploring the challenges and opportunities of a broadening real estate asset class, and the importance of a coherent benchmarking framework to be clear on your performance drag and drivers. We then examine risk on three fronts: geopolitical risk, technological driven disruption, and private real estates' exposure to climate change. O This past year saw the industrial boom continue, retail slide and global asset-level real estate delivering a total return of 7.4%, slightly down on the year before. So, in the final chapter we zoom out and look at big picture late cycle investing, global property performance and market size. At MSCI Real Estate we uncover the data behind the headlines to provide you with actionable insights to help you keep pace with industry change and make better investment decisions-wherever you sit in the investment process},

abstract = {Consensus is a fundamental problem of distributed computing. While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues.In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains.},

Even after imputing returns of -100% to ICOs that don't list their tokens within 60 days and adjusting for the returns of the asset class, the representative ICO investor earns 82%. After trading begins, tokens continue to appreciate in price, generating average buy-and-hold abnormal returns of 48% in the first 30 trading days. We also study the determinants of ICO underpricing and relate cryptocurrency prices to Twitter followers and activity.

abstract = {Building trustless cross-blockchain trading protocols is challenging. Centralized exchanges thus remain the preferred route to execute transfers across blockchains. However, these services require trust and therefore undermine the very nature of the blockchains on which they operate. To overcome this, several decentralized exchanges have recently emerged which offer support for atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS). ACCS enable the trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and are the only known mechanism to do so. However, ACCS suffer significant limitations; they are slow, inefficient and costly, meaning that they are rarely used in practice. We present XCLAIM: the first generic framework for achieving trustless and efficient cross-chain exchanges using cryptocurrency-backed assets (CbAs). XCLAIM offers protocols for issuing, transferring, swapping and redeeming CbAs securely in a non-interactive manner on existing blockchains. We instantiate XCLAIM between Bitcoin and Ethereum and evaluate our implementation; it costs less than USD 0.50 to issue an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin-backed tokens on Ethereum. We show XCLAIM is not only faster, but also significantly cheaper than atomic cross-chain swaps. Finally, XCLAIM is compatible with the majority of existing blockchains without modification, and enables several novel cryptocurrency applications, such as cross-chain payment channels and efficient multi-party swaps.},

Cross-chain communication thereby plays a fundamental role in cryptocurrency exchanges, sharding, as well as the bootstrapping and migration of distributed ledgers.

In this paper, we provide the first systematic exposition of protocols for cross-chain communication. Through formalization of the underlying research question, which reduces to the fair exchange problem, we identify threat and network model assumptions, necessary for designing correct cross-chain communication protocols. We overview main applications, derive a classification and provide a comparative analysis of existing approaches. Further, we survey and classify techniques for verifying state cross-chain and mechanisms for constructing locks.},

@inproceedings{Hirai2017a,
abstract = {Motivation. Public ledger is a decentralized book keeping technology and is believed to have the potential to revolutionize many areas. Besides handling crypto-currency, public ledger can be used to tokenize arbitrary assets, and then support trading of these asset tokens in a decentralized manner. With public ledger based token trading system, users do not necessarily convert their assets to currencies, but can exchange assets directly. It also avoids unnecessary transportation as the asset only needs to be physically transferred to its last owner. Furthermore, utilization of the public ledger does not require that users have to trust each other in order to trade tokens safely. However, using decentralized public ledger for trading asset tokens raises serious privacy concerns. Because token ownership information is stored on the public ledger and disclosed to the public, anyone can uncover users trading activities and history. For a token based asset trading platform, all tokens are unique and transactions are usually two-ways or multi-ways. In response to these challenges, we propose ZeroTrade, a privacy respecting heterogeneous assets trading system that leverages various cryptography tools to conceal the exchange trace of asset tokens and takes advantage of public ledger for guaranteeing fairness of asset token exchange. Solution. ZeroTrade involves trusted hubs that are responsible for converting assets to tokens and back, where trusted means that hubs will generate/accept valid tokens, and uses the public ledger to record all token exchange information. When two or more users want to exchange tokens with each other, each user picks an agent for the exchange. Asset tokens are first poured into a pool and users leverage agents to obliviously retrieve tokens from the pool in order to finish the exchange. The oblivious retrieving process cut off the connection between the original user and the agent. Therefore, one cannot determine the relationship between the original users who want to exchange tokens by observing information recorded on the public ledger. To implement the design, ZeroTrade leverages different cryptography tools including zero-knowledge proof and various encryption techniques. Considering various demands in token trade, ZeroTrade also supports operations like partial token trade and revocation. A preliminary evaluation of the performance shows that ZeroTrade only adds limited burden on top of the public ledger. More detailed information can be found in the full version of the paper. Conclusion. ZeroTrade provides a privacy friendly platform for asset trading based on public ledger. For the next step, we plan to implement a fully functional prototype and considering more complex token trading scenarios. {\textcopyright} International Financial Cryptography Association 2017.},

abstract = {Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology diffuses more broadly among later users (1–7). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful diffusion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual diffusion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader diffusion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.},

The results suggest that ICOs create, on average, investor value in the short run. Raw and abnormal first-day returns range from 6.8% to 8.2%. This is consistent with the market liquidity hypothesis of ICOs according to which issuers have an incentive to underprice in order to generate market liquidity, which, in turn, increases the inherent value of their virtual currency. I also study the determinants of first-day returns, total funding, money left on the table, time-to-market, and the failure of projects. Further, evidence on the sensitivity of ICO pricing to important industry events such as major hacks and regulatory actions is presented.},

abstract = {Distributed financial systems are radically changing the way we do business and spend our money. Ripple, in particular, is unique in its kind. It is built on consensus and trust among its users and it allows to exchange both fiat currencies and goods over its network. It does so by storing the accounts of its users, their balances, and all the transactions in a distributed ledger, publicly accessible. In this paper we perform an in-depth study of the Ripple exchange system and its public distributed ledger. We analyze payments, the structure of payment paths, and the role of the entities in the system such as Gateways (the equivalent of banks) and Market Makers. We also analyze the internal stream of events and show that Ripple relies on a surprisingly small number of active validators, raising concerns on the actual robustness and fairness of the system. Moreover, we consider the degree of anonymity that Ripple is able to guarantee. By examining the first three years of Ripple history (more than 500 GB worth of data), we show that even approximate information on a single payment can uncover, with incredible accuracy, the entire financial life of the user. For example, anyone who overhears our order of a Latte at our favourite bar can easily get complete and unlimited access to our balance, our previous and future payments, our monthly income, as well as critical information about the places where we shop and the people we trust. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

A framework for the bilateral transfer of information and knowledge is proposed to magnify the impact of forensic science laboratories on abating crime, strengthening security, and reinforcing the criminal justice system. To accomplish digital transformations, laboratories require personnel with different expertise, including investigative reasoning, knowledge codifi-cation, data analytics, and forensic intelligence. Ultimately, this study encourages managers, educators, researchers, and policymakers to look beyond the usefulness of forensic results for solving individual investigations, and to realize the value of combined forensic knowledge and intelligence for developing broader strategies to deal with crime in digitalized society.},

abstract = {Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or "intrinsic value" and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin"), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ("smart contracts") or even blockchain-based "decentralized autonomous organizations" (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

We provide the first systematic analysis of the benefits and threats of arbitrary blockchain content. Our analysis shows that certain content, e.g., illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal. Based on these insights, we conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of unintended content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Although most data originates from benign extensions to Bitcoin's protocol, our analysis reveals more than 1600 files on the blockchain, over 99% of which are texts or images. Among these files there is clearly objectionable content such as links to child pornography, which is distributed to all Bitcoin participants. With our analysis, we thus highlight the importance for future blockchain designs to address the possibility of unintended data insertion and protect blockchain users accordingly.},

Token holders can post progressively-larger Reputation bonds to dispute proposed market outcomes. If the size of these bonds reaches a certain threshold, Reputation splits into multiple versions, one for each possible outcome of the disputed market; token holders must then exchange their Reputation tokens for one of these versions. Versions of Reputation which do not correspond to the real-world outcome will become worthless, as no one will participate in prediction markets unless they are confident that the markets will resolve correctly. Therefore, token holders will select the only version of Reputation which they know will continue to have value: the version that corresponds to reality.},

We explain that emerging blockchain technology is certainly a promising platform for implementing smart contracts but argue that there is a large class of applications, where blockchain is inadequate due to performance, scalability, and consistency requirements, and also due to language expressiveness and cost issues that are hard to solve. We explain that in some situations a centralised approach that does not rely on blockchain is a better alternative due to its simplicity, scalability, and performance. We suggest that in applications where decentralisation and transparency are essential, developers can advantageously combine the two approaches into hybrid solutions where some operations are enforced by enforcers deployed on--blockchains and the rest by enforcers deployed on trusted third parties.},

abstract = {With the rapid increase of threats on the Internet, people are continuously seeking privacy and anonymity. Services such as Bitcoin and Tor were introduced to provide anonymity for online transactions and Web browsing. Due to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user. We investigate the feasibility of deanonymizing users of Tor hidden services who rely on Bitcoin as a payment method by exploiting public information leaked from online social networks, the Blockchain, and onion websites. This, for example, allows an adversary to link a user with @alice Twitter address to a Tor hidden service with private.onion address by finding at least one past transaction in the Blockchain that involves their publicly declared Bitcoin addresses. To demonstrate the feasibility of this deanonymization attack, we carried out a real-world experiment simulating a passive, limited adversary. We crawled 1.5K hidden services and collected 88 unique Bitcoin addresses. We then crawled 5B tweets and 1M BitcoinTalk forum pages and collected 4.2K and 41K unique Bitcoin addresses, respectively. Each user address was associated with an online identity along with its public profile information. By analyzing the transactions in the Blockchain, we were able to link 125 unique users to 20 Tor hidden services, including sensitive ones, such as The Pirate Bay and Silk Road. We also analyzed two case studies in detail to demonstrate the implications of the resulting information leakage on user anonymity. In particular, we confirm that Bitcoin addresses should always be considered exploitable, as they can be used to deanonymize users retroactively. This is especially important for Tor hidden service users who actively seek and expect privacy and anonymity.},

The objective is to develop insights into the evolution of the Bitcoin economy during this period. For this, we establish and analyze a novel integrated dataset that enriches data from the Bitcoin blockchain with off-network data such as business categories and geo-locations. Our analyses reveal the major Bitcoin businesses and markets. Our results also give insights on the business distribution by countries and how businesses evolve over time. We also show that there is a gambling network that features many very small transactions. Furthermore, regional differences in the adoption and business distribution could be found. In the network analysis, the small world phenomenon is investigated and confirmed for several subgraphs of the Bitcoin network.},

abstract = {Atomic Swap enables two parties to atomically exchange their own cryptocurrencies without trusted third parties. This paper provides the first quantitative analysis on the fairness of the Atomic Swap protocol, and proposes the first fair Atomic Swap protocol with implementations. In particular, we model the Atomic Swap as the American Call Option, and prove that an Atomic Swap is equivalent to an American Call Option without the premium. Thus, the Atomic Swap is unfair to the swap participant. Then, we quantify the fairness of the Atomic Swap and compare it with that of conventional financial assets (stocks and fiat currencies). The quantification results show that the the Atomic Swap is much more unfair on cryptocurrencies than on stocks and fiat currencies in the same setting. Moreover, we use the conventional Cox-Ross-Rubinstein option pricing model in Finance to estimate the premium, and show that the estimated premium for cryptocurrencies is 2% ∼ 3% of the asset value, while the premium for stocks and fiat currencies is approximately 0.3%. Furthermore, we propose two fair Atomic Swap protocols, one is for currency exchange and the other is for American Call Options. Our protocols are based on the original Atomic Swap protocol, but implement the premium mechanism. Blockchains supporting smart contracts such as Ethereum support our protocols directly. Blockchains only supporting scripts such as Bitcoin can support our protocols by adding a simple opcode. Finally, we provide the reference implementation of our protocols in Solidity, and give detailed instructions on implementing our protocols with Bitcoin script.},

abstract = {The bookkeeping accounting method recognized all over the world is based on the so-called double entry, with which in each account (defined T-Account for its shape) there are two sections, Debit and Credit. These two sections take on different meanings depending on the nature of each account. The double entry is an exceptional consolidated accounting method that dates back to the fifteenth century, however it has highlighted limits in terms of auditing. The single entry did not take into account the cross relations between the accounts, reporting only on the journal. The double entry has overcome this limit by introducing the ledger, but a cross-check of the mirrored transactions recorded by the other companies is still missing. The introduction of blockchain technology could now offer a new opportunity to ensure further auditing control. The transition from double entry to triple entry is therefore only a matter of time. The blockchain itself is borrowing the word "ledger" from accounting and now it is time for accounting to introduce a third leg (another axis) to the T-Accounts, that can be turned into a new X-shaped version of accounts. This third axis can be used to include the unique identifier of each transaction represented by the Hash. CCS Concepts • Applied Computing➝Law, Social and behavioral sciences➝Economics.},

The above processes is executed continuously by the Oracle in parallel to the Blockchain network. It therefore implements looping constructs that makes the combined Oracle and Blockchain system Turing Complete. As old blocks cannot be erased from the Blockchain, but new blocks can be added, the Oracle and the Blockchain will work as a non-erasable Turing Machine as described in Minsky et al. (1967). We will discuss the use of the Oracle in applications including: • Distributed data storage • Distributed computing • The control of drones. We will also describe how metadata storage and digital signature authorization on the Blockchain can be useful features for implementing these applications.},

abstract = {Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptographic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bitcoin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bitcoin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications , providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disintermediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disintermediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison.},

It also attracts scams, for example, a Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help to deal with this issue and to provide reusable research data sets for future research, this paper collects real-world samples and proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts (i.e., smart Ponzi schemes) on the blockchain. First, 200 smart Ponzi schemes are obtained by manually checking more than 3,000 open source smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Then, two kinds of features are extracted from the transaction history and operation codes of the smart contracts. Finally, a classification model is presented to detect smart Ponzi schemes. The extensive experiments show that the proposed model performs better than many traditional classification models and can achieve high accuracy for practical use. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 500 smart Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.},

In this paper we survey the 21,270 vulnerable contracts reported by five recent academic projects. Contrary to what might have been believed given the reported number of vulnerable contracts, there has been precious little in terms of actual exploitation when it comes to these vulnerabilities. We find that at most 504 out of 21,270 contracts have been subjected to exploits. This corresponds to at most 9,094 ETH (1 million USD), or only 0.30% of the 3 million ETH (350 million USD) claimed in some of the papers. While we are certainly not implying that smart contract vulnerability research is without merit, our results suggest that the potential impact of vulnerable code had been greatly exaggerated.},

Using a generalized Metcalfe's Law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) is exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of Bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways Bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).},

Through its implementation of delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) consensus and an architectural design focused on parallel processing and full-duplex communication, the EOS system attempts to provide a decentralized application development environment which offers high transactional throughput. Since the public release of the EOS main-net, multiple parties have speculated and made claims of the systems ability to provide processing capabilities in the range of 5,000 to 1,000,000 transactions per second. However, such performance has yet to be observed in a production network. No comprehensive analysis of the EOS system architecture has been conducted to determine the capabilities of the network. The following document outlines the results of a three-month research initiative to analyze the architecture of the EOS system and benchmark its functional performance under a range of environmental conditions. Through practical testing and experiments in a controlled laboratory setting, this research provides a thorough and objective model of its design, performance, and economics in order to present a reference for the blockchain community.},

abstract = {Smart Contracts have gained tremendous popularity in the past few years, to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every day through such technology. However, since the release of the Frontier network of Ethereum in 2015, there have been many cases in which the execution of Smart Contracts managing Ether coins has led to problems or conflicts. Compared to traditional Software Engineering, a discipline of Smart Contract and Blockchain programming, with standardized best practices that can help solve the mentioned problems and conflicts, is not yet sufficiently developed. Furthermore, Smart Contracts rely on a non-standard software life-cycle, according to which, for instance, delivered applications can hardly be updated or bugs resolved by releasing a new version of the software. In this paper we advocate the need for a discipline of Blockchain Software Engineering, addressing the issues posed by smart contract programming and other applications running on blockchains.We analyse a case of study where a bug discovered in a Smart Contract library, and perhaps 'unsafe»' programming, allowed an attack on Parity, a wallet application, causing the freezing of about 500K Ethers (about 150M USD, in November 2017). In this study we analyze the source code of Parity and the library, and discuss how recognised best practices could mitigate, if adopted and adapted, such detrimental software misbehavior. We also reflect on the specificity of Smart Contract software development, which makes some of the existing approaches insufficient, and call for the definition of a specific Blockchain Software Engineering.},

The exact properties that Cobalt satisfies makes it particularly applicable to designing an efficient decentralized "voting network" that allows a public, open-entry group of nodes to agree on changes to some shared set of rules in a fair and consistent manner while tolerating some trusted nodes and arbitrarily many untrusted nodes behaving maliciously. We also define a new set of properties which must be satisfied by any safe decentralized governance algorithm, and all of which Cobalt satisfies.},

abstract = {Crypto-currencies have developed a vibrant market since bitcoin, the first crypto-currency, was created in 2009. We look at the properties of crypto-currencies as financial assets in a broad cross-section. We discuss approaches of altcoins to generate value and their trading and information platforms. Then we investigate crypto-currencies as alternative investment assets, studying their returns and the co-movements of altcoin prices with bitcoin and against each other. We evaluate their addition to investors' portfolios and document they are indeed able to enhance the diversification of portfolios due to their little co-movements with established assets, as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate pure portfolios of crypto-currencies: an equally-weighted one, a value-weighted one, and one based on the CRypto-currency IndeX (CRIX). The CRIX portfolio displays lower risk than any individual of the liquid crypto-currencies. We also document the changing characteristics of the crypto-currency market. Deepening liquidity is accompanied by a rise in market value, and a growing number of altcoins is contributing larger amounts to aggregate crypto-currency market capitalization.},

abstract = {This chapter contributes to evolving the versatility and complexity of blockchain-enabled services through extending the functionality of blockchain-enforced smart contracts. The contributions include: (i) a method for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) a method for efficient and secure matching and transfer of smart-contract underlyings (entities) among disparate smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) a method for producing an hierarchy of common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased security in the context of smart contracts/subcontracts/underlyings; and (iv) a method for building secure and optimized repositories through distributed hash tables in the context of contracts/ subcontracts/underlyings. These methods help providing services that allow both narrower and worldwide reach and distribution of resources. The longevity of the blockchain technology is achieved through continuous innovation. Blockchain-enabled services are potentially an efficient, secure, automated, and cost-effective alternative or complement to current service infrastructures in a range of domains (legal, medical, financial, government, IoT).},

abstract = {Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.},

A plethora of shortest-path algorithms is studied in the literature that span across multiple disciplines. This paper presents a survey of shortest-path algorithms based on a taxonomy that is introduced in the paper. One dimension of this taxonomy is the various flavors of the shortest-path problem. There is no one general algorithm that is capable of solving all variants of the shortest-path problem due to the space and time complexities associated with each algorithm. Other important dimensions of the taxonomy include whether the shortest-path algorithm operates over a static or a dynamic graph, whether the shortest-path algorithm produces exact or approximate answers, and whether the objective of the shortest-path algorithm is to achieve time-dependence or is to only be goal directed. This survey studies and classifies shortest-path algorithms according to the proposed taxonomy. The survey also presents the challenges and proposed solutions associated with each category in the taxonomy.},

However, in the Mixcoin protocol, the mapping from a user's input to output address is visible to the mixing server. We modify the Mixcoin protocol to provide guarantees that the input/output address mapping for any user is kept hidden from the mixing server. In order to achieve this, we make use of a blind signature scheme [14,23] as well as an append-only public log. The scheme is fully compatible with Bitcoin, forces mixes to be accountable, preserves user anonymity even against a malicious mix, is resilient to denial of service attacks, and easily scales to many users.},

@article{Catalini2018,
abstract = {This paper explores how entrepreneurs can use initial coin offerings — whereby they issue crypto tokens and commit to accept only those tokens as payment for their products — to fund venture start-up costs. We show that the ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, giving it value. We find that venture returns are independent of any committed growth in the supply of tokens over time, but that initial funds raised are maximized by setting that growth to zero to encourage saving by early participants. Nonetheless, since token value depends on a single period of demand, their ability to raise funds is more limited than traditional equity finance. A lack of commitment in monetary policy does, however, undermine saving, and therefore the cost of using tokens to fund start-up costs is inflexibility in future capital raises. Crypto tokens can also facilitate coordination among stakeholders within digital ecosystems when network effects are present.},

@techreport{Bunz,
abstract = {Decentralized smart contract platforms such as Ethereum have recently become immensely popular. Unlike Bitcoin's transaction-based system, smart contracts are arbitrary pieces of code that sit on a blockchain and facilitate fine-grained control over the distribution of assets. Unfortunately, as of today, there is no fully-decentralized way to conduct transactions privately on such a powerful platform. In this paper, we propose Zether, a private payment mechanism that is compatible with Ethereum and other account-based payment systems. Zether can provide both confidentiality (by hiding payment amounts) and anonymity (by hiding the identities of senders and recipients). We take an account-based approach similar to Ethereum for efficiency and usability. Namely, we implement a new Ethereum smart contract that stores confidential account information for users and provides privacy-preserving functionalities for depositing, transferring, and withdrawing funds to/from these accounts with only a small overhead. We describe techniques to protect Zether against replay attacks and front-running situations and provide mechanisms to allow Zether inter-operate with arbitrary smart contracts to support applications such as sealed-bid auctions, payment channels, stake voting, and confidential proof-of-stake. As a part of our protocol, we propose $\Sigma$-Bullets, an improvement of the existing zero-knowledge proof system, Bulletproofs. $\Sigma$-Bullets make Bulletproofs more inter-operable with Sigma protocols, which is of general interest. We implement Zether as an Ethereum smart contract and show the practicality of our design by measuring the amount of gas used by the Zether contract. A Zether confidential transaction currently costs about 0.0129 ETH or approximately $2.72. We discuss how small changes to Ethereum, which are already being discussed independently of Zether, would drastically reduce this cost.},

We present a model rationalizing ICOs for launching such platforms: by transparently distributing tokens before the platform operation begins, an ICO overcomes later coordination failures between transaction counterparties induced by a cross-side network effect. In addition, we rationalize several empirical features of the ICO structure in the presence of a critical mass requirement imposed by a same-side network effect. Our model provides guidance for both regulators and practitioners to discern which ICOs are economically valuable.},

abstract = {Recent attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) network demonstrated that its transaction-flooding protocols, which are used to ensure network consistency, may enable user deanonymization—the linkage of a user's IP address with her pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. In 2015, the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the network's flooding mechanism to a different protocol, known as diffusion. However, it is unclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper, we model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties, both pre-and post-2015. The core problem is one of epidemic source inference over graphs, where the observational model and spreading mechanisms are informed by Bitcoin's implementation; notably, these models have not been studied in the epidemic source detection literature before. We identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators. This analysis suggests that Bitcoin's networking protocols (both pre-and post-2015) offer poor anonymity properties on networks with a regular-tree topology. We confirm this claim in simulation on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.},
