abstract = {A low-trust notary could replace conventional transaction servers and would allow users to gain access to safe, fast, inexpensive, off-chain transactions with increased functionality. We propose a solution that enables parties to contract with each other without being able to defraud each other, and to issue currencies and to prove all balances, as well as prove which instruments are valid and which transactions have closed, without storing any history except for the last signed receipt. Theft of reserves and counterfeiting are prevented by storing cryptocurrency reserves in multi-signature voting pools consisting of notaries who audit each other in real time and then vote multi-signature on the blockchain to release coins only when authorized by users' signed receipts.},

abstract = {Assuming that firms' suppliers are better able to extract value from the liquidation of assets in default and have an information advantage over other creditors, the paper derives six predictions on the use of trade credit. (1) Financially unconstrained firms (with unused bank credit lines) take trade credit to exploit the supplier's liquidation advantage. (2) If inputs purchased on account are sufficiently liquid, the reliance on trade credit does not depend on credit rationing. (3) Firms buying goods make more purchases on account than those buying services, while suppliers of services offer more trade credit than those of standardized goods. (4) Suppliers lend inputs to their customers but not cash. (5) Greater reliance on trade credit is associated with more intensive use of tangible inputs. (6) Better creditor protection decreases both the use of trade credit and input tangibility.},

We find that approximately one-quarter of bitcoin users and one-half of bitcoin transactions are associated with illegal activity. Around {\$}72 billion of illegal activity per year involves bitcoin, which is close to the scale of the US and European markets for illegal drugs. The illegal share of bitcoin activity declines with mainstream interest in bitcoin and with the emergence of more opaque cryptocurrencies. The techniques developed in this paper have applications in cryptocurrency surveillance. Our findings suggest that cryptocurrencies are transforming the way black markets operate by enabling “black e-commerce.”},

abstract = {Blockchain technology becomes increasingly popular. It also attracts scams, for example, Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.},

These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common component explains 80{\%} of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.},

abstract = {This paper integrates the theory of money and credit derived ultimately from Wicksell into the Keynesian theory of income determination, with assets allocated according to Tobinesque principles. The model deployed has much in common with the modern 'endogenous money' school initiated by Kaldor which emphasises the essential role played by credit in any real life economy, since production takes time and the future is always uncertain. New ground is broken methodologically because all the propositions are justified by simulations of a rigorous (60-equation) model, making it possible to pin down exactly why the results come out as they do. One conclusion of the paper is that there is no such thing as a supply of money distinct from the money which agents wish to hold, or find themselves holding. This finding is inimical, possibly in the end lethal, to the way macroeconomics is currently taught as well as to the neoclassical paradigm itself.},

The results suggest that ICOs create, on average, investor value in the short run. Raw and abnormal first-day returns range from 6.8{\%} to 8.2{\%}. This is consistent with the market liquidity hypothesis of ICOs according to which issuers have an incentive to underprice in order to generate market liquidity, which, in turn, increases the inherent value of their virtual currency. I also study the determinants of first-day returns, total funding, money left on the table, time-to-market, and the failure of projects. Further, evidence on the sensitivity of ICO pricing to important industry events such as major hacks and regulatory actions is presented.},

abstract = {Multifractal Detrended Cross-Correlation methodology is applied to the foreign exchange (Forex) market. High frequency fluctuations of exchange rates of eight major world currencies over the period 2010--2018 are used to study cross-correlations. The currencies include the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar and US dollar. Dominant multiscale cross--correlations between the exchange rates are found to typically occur on the level of small and medium size fluctuations. Hierarchical organization of ties between the exchange rates, formulated in terms of the dendrograms, are however more pronounced on the level of larger fluctuations. The cross--correlations are quantified to be stronger on average between those exchange rate pairs that are bound within triangular relation. Some pairs from outside the triangular relation are however identified to be exceptionally strongly correlated as compared to the average strength of correlations in this sector. This in particular applies to those exchange rates that involve the Australian and New Zealand dollars and reflects their economic relations. Significant events with impact on the Forex are shown to induce triangular arbitrage opportunities which at the same time reduce cross--correlations on the smallest time scales and act destructively on the multiscale organization of correlations. In the years 2010--2018 such instances took place in connection with the Swiss National Bank intervention and the weakening of British pound sterling accompanying the initiation of Brexit procedure.},

We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far. We analyse the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts, providing a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls which may lead to vulnerabilities. We show a series of attacks which exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an adversary to steal money or cause other damage.},

In the financial industry, blockchain technology allows for the rise of decentralized financial services, which tend to be more decentralized, innovative, interoperable, borderless, and transparent. Empowered by blockchain technology, decentralized financial services have the potential to broaden financial inclusion, facilitate open access, encourage permissionless innovation, and create new opportunities for entrepreneurs and innovators. In this article, we assess the benefits of decentralized finance, identify existing business models, and evaluate potential challenges and limits. As a new area of financial technology, decentralized finance may reshape the structure of modern finance and create a new landscape for entrepreneurship and innovation, showcasing the promises and challenges of decentralized business models.},

abstract = {Governments worldwide are increasingly recognizing that assisting the development of start-ups and small to medium enterprises may be critical to fostering job creation and economic growth. As such, there is a concerted effort to rework securities regulation to encourage the funding of these businesses through innovative approaches such as crowdfunding. However, one major problem with investing in securities issued through crowdfunding is that investors typically have limited to no ability to sell the securities. There are a number of over-the-counter, venture and small company markets trying to bridge that gap and proposals in some countries to develop new markets for these types of securities. However, such markets present significant regulatory challenges, as they have historically been plagued by fraud and “pump and dump” manipulation schemes. This Article considers these regulatory challenges and explores how regulators can work to improve the integrity of these markets as a way of encouraging their development.},

@article{Catalini2018,
abstract = {This paper explores how entrepreneurs can use initial coin offerings — whereby they issue crypto tokens and commit to accept only those tokens as payment for future use of a digital platform — to fund venture start-up costs. We show that the ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, which, in turn, reveals consumer value without the entrepreneurs having to know, ex ante, consumer willingness to pay. We find that venture returns are independent of any committed growth in the supply of tokens over time, but that initial funds raised are maximized by setting that growth to zero to encourage saving by early participants. Furthermore, by revealing key aspects of consumer demand, crypto tokens may increase entrepreneurial returns beyond what can be achieved through traditional equity financing. A lack of commitment in monetary policy can, however, undermine saving and, thus, the cost of using tokens to fund start-up costs is potential inflexibility in future capital raising. Crypto tokens can also facilitate coordination among stakeholders within digital ecosystems when network effects are present. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, SETLcoin, Ether, Solar Coin, or Liberty Reserve exist since 2009. Because of their decentralized control, they are often considered a threat or alternative to the conventional centralized banking system. While the technological implication of some such currencies, especially of Bitcoin, has attracted much attention, so far there is little discussion about the entire field of cryptocurrencies and very little academic literature addressing its ethical significance. In this article, we thus address the impact of “blockchain technology” on the nature of financial transactions from a business ethics perspective. We begin with a survey on relevant literature from neighboring disciplines. Next, we work towards a 3 × 3 framework for current debates on the ethics of cryptocurrencies (see Table 1): we combine the micro, meso, and macro levels of business and society with assessments of the potential ethical impact of cryptocurrencies as morally beneficial, detrimental, and ambiguous. In addition, we highlight possible avenues for future research, such as the changing roles of the miners and regulators, the prosocial use of cryptocurrencies, the antisocial use for shadow banking and transactions in the ‘dark net' and cryptocurrencies' effect on inflation and deflation.},

Each case study was designed to collect as random a group as practicable of problem secured loans in the portfolio of an institutional lender and to study what happened to those loans. The 3 case studies produced evidence of striking homogeneity. All 3 case studies suggest that, even on distressed loans, it is unusual for secured creditors to take possession of their collateral, that it is common for secured creditors to be repaid through refinancing or sale of their collateral, and that the great majority of their debtors' businesses survive unscathed in the face of the distress that causes the secured creditor to terminate its relationship with the debtor.},

@article{Ahmed2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND All methods routinely used to generate safety signals from pharmacovigilance databases rely on disproportionality analyses of counts aggregating patients' spontaneous reports. Recently, it was proposed to analyze individual spontaneous reports directly using Bayesian lasso logistic regressions. Nevertheless, this raises the issue of choosing an adequate regularization parameter in a variable selection framework while accounting for computational constraints due to the high dimension of the data. PURPOSE Our main objective is to propose a method, which exploits the subsampling idea from Stability Selection, a variable selection procedure combining subsampling with a high-dimensional selection algorithm, and adapts it to the specificities of the spontaneous reporting data, the latter being characterized by their large size, their binary nature and their sparsity. MATERIALS AND METHOD Given the large imbalance existing between the presence and absence of a given adverse event, we propose an alternative subsampling scheme to that of Stability Selection resulting in an over-representation of the minority class and a drastic reduction in the number of observations in each subsample. Simulations are used to help define the detection threshold as regards the average proportion of false signals. They are also used to compare the performances of the proposed sampling scheme with that originally proposed for Stability Selection. Finally, we compare the proposed method to the gamma Poisson shrinker, a disproportionality method, and to a lasso logistic regression approach through an empirical study conducted on the French national pharmacovigilance database and two sets of reference signals. RESULTS Simulations show that the proposed sampling strategy performs better in terms of false discoveries and is faster than the equiprobable sampling of Stability Selection. The empirical evaluation illustrates the better performances of the proposed method compared with gamma Poisson shrinker and the lasso in terms of number of reference signals retrieved.},

abstract = {Several new services incentivize clients to compete in solving large computation tasks in exchange for financial rewards. This model of competitive distributed computation enables every user connected to the Internet to participate in a game in which he splits his computational power among a set of competing pools - the game is called a computational power splitting game. We formally model this game and show its utility in analyzing the security of pool protocols that dictate how financial rewards are shared among the members of a pool. As a case study, we analyze the Bitcoin crypto currency which attracts computing power roughly equivalent to billions of desktop machines, over 70{\%} of which is organized into public pools. We show that existing pool reward sharing protocols are insecure in our game-theoretic analysis under an attack strategy called the "block withholding attack". This attack is a topic of debate, initially thought to be ill-incentivized in today's pool protocols: i.e., causing a net loss to the attacker, and later argued to be always profitable. Our analysis shows that the attack is always well-incentivized in the long-run, but may not be so for a short duration. This implies that existing pool protocols are insecure, and if the attack is conducted systematically, Bitcoin pools could lose millions of dollars worth in months. The equilibrium state is a mixed strategy - that is - in equilibrium all clients are incentivized to probabilistically attack to maximize their payoffs rather than participate honestly. As a result, the Bitcoin network is incentivized to waste a part of its resources simply to compete.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is an innovative decentralized cryptocurrency whose core security relies on a "proof of work" procedure, which requires network participants to repeatedly compute hashes on inputs from a large search space. Finding one of the rare inputs that generates sin extremely low hash value is considered a successful attempt, allowing miners to approve new transactions and, in return, to collect rewards in bitcoins. This reward allocation, which provides the incentive for miners to participate, is a random process with a large variance. Miners who desire a steady income thus often participate in mining pools that divide among their members the earned rewards, and reduce this variance. Mining pools sure slightly better at coordinating participants due to lowerlatency communication, a fact which implies that they manage to collect slightly higher rewards. We examine dynamics of pooled mining and the rewards that pools manage to collect, and use cooperative game theoretic tools to analyze how pool members may share these rewards. We show that for some network parameters, especially under high transaction loads, it is difficult or even impossible to distribute rewards in a stable way: some participants are always incentivized to switch between pools.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {— Cryptocurrencies have recently experienced a new wave of price volatility and interest; activity within social media communities relating to cryptocurrencies has increased significantly. There is currently limited documented knowledge of factors which could indicate future price movements. This paper aims to decipher relationships between cryptocurrency price changes and topic discussion on social media to provide, among other things, an understanding of which topics are indicative of future price movements. To achieve this a well-known dynamic topic modelling approach is applied to social media communication to retrieve information about the temporal occurrence of various topics. A Hawkes model is then applied to find interactions between topics and cryptocurrency prices. The results show particular topics tend to precede certain types of price movements, for example the discussion of 'risk and investment vs trading' being indicative of price falls, the discussion of 'substantial price movements' being indicative of volatility, and the discussion of 'fundamental cryptocurrency value' by technical communities being indicative of price rises. The knowledge of topic relationships gained here could be built into a real-time system, providing trading or alerting signals.},

abstract = {The amount of available content on the Internet vastly outweighs the attention span of online users. In the last few years, crowdsourced content curation has emerged as a novel approach to the aggregation and filtering of content in social media platforms. As opposed to traditional curation techniques, it avoids the reliance on a central party to curate content, allowing online communities to self-regulate. The advent of blockchains and cryptocurrencies has created new ways for the distribution and ownership of financial value over the Internet. Steemit is a social media platform which establishes financial rewards for the crowdsourced curation of content using the cryptocurrencies of the Steem blockchain.
In this work we present an analysis of the Steem blockchain, focusing on the economic and incentives model of the platform. Then we identify and evaluate the main issues of the incentives model of Steemit. Namely, we analyze the self-voting pattern and
voting rings, moderation and censorship abuse in Steemit, and the types of voting bots in the platform. To better understand how self-voting can affect financially incentivized crowdsourced curation, we construct a formal model inspired by Steemit. Our model provides a formal framework which may be used in the evaluation of the incentive compatibility of Steemit or other decentralized content curation systems with monetary rewards. To conclude, we design and implement a solution for the moderation and censorship issues of Steemit in the form of a smart contract.},

abstract = {One of the most significant economic developments of the past decade has been the convergence of the financial services industry, particularly the capital markets and (re)insurance sectors. Convergence has been driven by the increase in the frequency and severity of catastrophic risk, market inefficiencies created by (re)insurance underwriting cycles, advances in computing and communications technologies, the emergence of enterprise risk management, and other factors. These developments have led to the development of hybrid insurance/financial instruments that blend elements of financial contracts with traditional reinsurance as well as new financial instruments patterned on asset‐backed securities, futures, and options that provide direct access to capital markets. This article provides a survey and overview of the hybrid and pure financial markets instruments and provides new information on the pricing and returns on contracts such as industry loss warranties and Cat bonds.},

We implemented MAIAN, the first tool for precisely specifying and reasoning about trace properties, which employs inter-procedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34,200 (2,365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract. On a subset of 3,759 contracts which we sampled for concrete validation and manual analysis, we reproduce real exploits at a true positive rate of 89{\%}, yielding exploits for3,686 contracts.

With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals and the public. However, a more comprehensive, evidence-based picture on the global direct financial impact of ransomware attacks is still missing. In this paper, we present a data-driven method for identifying and gathering information on Bitcoin transactions related to illicit activity based on footprints left on the public Bitcoin blockchain. We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source platform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35 ransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of each ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for ransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12,768,536 (22,967.54 BTC). We also find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players responsible for the majority of the payments. Based on these research findings, policy-makers and law enforcement agencies can use the statistics provided to understand the size of the illicit market and make informed decisions on how best to address the threat.},

abstract = {The surge of interest in cryptocurrencies has been accompanied by a proliferation of fraud. This paper examines a pervasive tactic long known to financial markets: pump and dump schemes. While the fundamentals of the ruse have not changed in the last century, the recent explosion of nearly 2,000 cryptocurrencies in a largely unregulated environment has greatly expanded the scope for abuse. The paper first quantifies the scope of cryptocurrency pump and dump on Discord and Telegram, two widely popular group messaging platforms with 130 million users and 200 million users respectively. Both platforms can handle large groups with thousands of users, and they are the most popular outlets for pump and dump schemes involving cryptocurrencies. We identified 3,767 different pump signals advertised on Telegram and another 1,051 different pump signals advertised on Discord during a six-month period in 2018. The schemes promoted more than 300 cryptocurrencies. This comprehensive data provides the first measure of the scope of pump and dump schemes across cryptocurrencies and suggest that this phenomenon is widespread and often quite profitable. This should raise concerns among regulators. We then examine which factors that affect the "success" of the pump, as measured by the percentage increase in price near the pump signal. We find that the coin's rank (market capitalization/volume) is the most important factor in determining the profitability of the pump: pumping obscure coins (with low volume) is much more profitable than pumping the dominant coins in the ecosystem.},

@article{Saleh2018,
abstract = {A blockchain constitutes a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network
of agents. Blockchain's value proposition requires that agents eventually agree
on the ledger's contents since payments possess risk otherwise. Restricted blockchains
ensure this consensus by appointing a central authority to dictate payment validity. Permissionless
blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum), however, admit no central authority
and therefore face a non-trivial issue of inducing consensus endogenously. Nakamoto
(2008) provided a temporary solution to the problem by invoking an economic mechanism
known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW, however, lacks sustainability, so, in recent
years, a variety of alternatives have been proposed. This paper studies the most famous
such alternative, Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I provide the first formal economic model
of PoS and demonstrate that PoS induces consensus in equilibrium. My result arises
because I endogenize blockchain coin prices. Propagating disagreement introduces risk
and thereby reduces blockchain coin value which implies that stake-holders face an implicit
cost from delaying consensus. PoS randomly selects a stake-holder to update the
blockchain and provides her an explicit monetary incentive, a “block reward,” for her
service. In the event of disagreement, block rewards constitute a perverse incentive, but
I demonstrate that restricting updating ability to large stake-holders induces an equilibrium
in which consensus obtains as soon as possible. I also demonstrate that consensus
obtains eventually almost surely in any equilibrium so long as the blockchain employs a
modest block reward schedule. My work reveals the economic viability of permissionless
blockchains},

While it has become increasingly clear that nominal price levels influence investor behavior, why prices matter to investors is a question that as of yet has gone unanswered. We find widespread evidence that investors systematically overestimate the skewness of low-priced stocks. In the broad cross-section of stocks, we find that investors substantially overweight the importance of price when forming skewness expectations. Asset pricing implications of our findings are borne out in the options market. A zero-cost option portfolio strategy that exploits investor overestimation of skewness for low-priced stocks generates significant abnormal returns. Finally, investor expectations of future skewness increase drastically on days that a stock undergoes a split to a lower nominal price. Empirically, however, future physical skewness decreases following splits.},

We are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. We conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e., gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises.},

Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.},

abstract = {We develop a theory of financing of entrepreneurial ventures via an initial coin offering (ICO). Pre-selling a venture's output by issuing tokens allows the entrepreneur to transfer part of the venture risk to diversified investors without diluting her control rights. This, however, leads to an agency conflict between the entrepreneur and investors that manifests itself in underinvestment. We show that an ICO can dominate traditional venture capital (VC) financing when VC investors are under-diversified, when the idiosyncratic component of venture risk is large enough, when the payoff distribution is sufficiently right-skewed, and when the degree of information asymmetry between the entrepreneur and ICO investors is not too large. Overall, our model suggests that an ICO can be a viable financing alternative for some but not all entrepreneurial ventures. An implication is that while regulating ICOs to reduce the information asymmetry associated with them is desirable, banning them outright is not.},

abstract = {One of the unique features of the digital currency Bitcoin is that new cash is introduced by so-called miners carrying out resourceintensive proof-of-work operations. To increase their chances of obtaining freshly minted bitcoins, miners typically join pools to collaborate on the computations. However, intense competition among mining pools has recently manifested in two ways. Miners may invest in additional computing resources to increase the likelihood of winning the next mining race. But, at times, a more sinister tactic is also employed: a mining pool may trigger a costly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to lower the expected success outlook of a competing mining pool. We explore the trade-off between these strategies with a series of game-theoretical models of competition between two pools of varying sizes. We consider differences in costs of investment and attack, as well as uncertainty over whether a DDoS attack will succeed. By characterizing the game's equilibria, we can draw a number of conclusions. In particular, we find that pools have a greater incentive to attack large pools than small ones. We also observe that larger mining pools have a greater incentive to attack than smaller ones.},

abstract = {Decentralization is a term widely used in a variety of contexts, particularly in political science and discourses surrounding the Internet. It is popular today among advocates of blockchain technology. While frequently employed as if it were a technical term, decentralization more reliably appears to operate as a rhetorical strategy that directs attention toward some aspects of a proposed social order and away from others. It is called for far more than it is theorized or consistently defined. This non-specificity has served to draw diverse participants into common political and technological projects. Yet even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate about how such power should operate. For decentralization to be a reliable concept in formulating future social arrangements and related technologies, it should come with high standards of specificity. It also cannot substitute for anticipating centralization with appropriate mechanisms of accountability.},

In this paper we present a holistic analysis that quantifies the full set of resources employed to monetize spam email-including naming, hosting, payment and fulfillment-using extensive measurements of three months of diverse spam data, broad crawling of naming and hosting infrastructures, and over 100 purchases from spam-advertised sites. We relate these resources to the organizations who administer them and then use this data to characterize the relative prospects for defensive interventions at each link in the spam value chain. In particular, we provide the first strong evidence of payment bottlenecks in the spam value chain; 95{\%} of spam-advertised pharmaceutical, replica and software products are monetized using merchant services from just a handful of banks.},

This also applies to the linkage between tangibility and debt maturity structure (measured as long-term debt over total debt). We find no evidence that industry concentration in different countries or changing composition of firms over time is driving our findings.

In particular, we propose a smart contract-based framework, which consists of multiple access control contracts (ACCs), one judge contract (JC) and one register contract (RC), to achieve distributed and trustworthy access control for IoT systems. Each ACC provides one access control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract platform to achieve the access control.},

abstract = {This paper studies the efficiency and price formation of bitcoin and other cryptocur-rency markets. First, there are large recurrent arbitrage opportunities in cryptocur-rency prices relative to fiat currencies across exchanges that often persist for several days or weeks. These price dispersions exist even in the face of significant trading volumes on many of the exchanges. The total size of arbitrage profits just from December 2017 to February 2018 is above of {\$}1 billion. Second, arbitrage opportunities are much larger across than within the same region; they are particularly large between the US, Japan and Korea, but smaller between the US and Europe. But spreads are much smaller when trading one cryptocurrency against another, suggesting that cross-border controls on fiat currencies play an important role. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common component and an idiosyncratic, exchange-specific one. We show that the common component explains up to 85{\%} of the variation in bitcoin returns and that the idiosyncratic components of order flow play an important role in explaining the size of the arbitrage spreads between exchanges.},

abstract = {Using insights from prosecuted cases, we present compelling evidence of large-trade based manipulation in a sizeable number of Indian IPOs that, in all likelihood escaped enforcement actions. Consistent with the pump-and-dump scheme these IPOs exhibit abnormally high volume of large trades, a significant fraction of which originates from a syndicate of traders present in the prosecuted IPOs. More importantly, stock price in the manipulated IPOs rises initially on account of artificial trades, but then declines significantly as the manipulators exit the market. Interestingly, not all attempts at manipulation are entirely successful as stock price in some of the manipulated IPOs crash on the first day of listing.},

abstract = {We analyze repeated moral hazard with discounting in a competitive credit market with risk neutrality. Even without learning or risk aversion, long-term bank-borrower relationships are welfare enhancing. The main result is that the borrower obtains an infinite sequence of unsecured loans at below spot market cost following the first good project realization. This contract produces first-best action choices. Prior to this stage, the borrower gets secured loans with above-market borrowing cost. The optimal contract thus displays a "selective memory" feature, taking only one of two forms at any given point in time, depending on prior history.},

abstract = {Participants in cryptocurrency markets are in constant communication with each other about the latest coins and news releases. Do these conversations build hype through the contagiousness of excitement, help the community process information, or play some other role? Using a novel dataset from a major cryptocurrency forum, we conduct an exploratory study of the characteristics of online discussion around cryptocurrencies. Through a regression analysis, we ind that coins with more information available and higher levels of technical innovation are associated with higher quality discussion. People who talk about {\l}serious{\v{z}} coins tend to participate in discussion displaying signatures of collective intelligence and information processing, while people who talk about {\l}less serious{\v{z}} coins tend to display signatures of hype and na{\"{i}}vety. Interviews with experienced forum members also conirm these quantitative indings. These results highlight the varied roles of discussion in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and suggest that discussion of serious coins may be oriented towards earnest, perhaps more accurate, attempts at discovering which coins are likely to succeed.

Although the second of these two groups of writings merits serious and current attention, the former group has been emphasized at the expense of works that can contribute enormously to our understanding of users and recordkeeping systems. This negligence limits our understanding of users, recordkeeping systems, and access issues and minimizes the significance of records as both agent, surrogate, and remnant of human activity and communication. Three recently published volumes from this ignored genre of literature are examined here.

We show how the lack of time priority in the period between the publication of a transaction and its validation by miners or designated participants can expose a transaction's footprint to the market, resulting in potential front-running and manipulation. We propose a cryptographic approach for solving information leakage problems in distributed ledgers that relies on using a hash (or fingerprint) to secure time priority, followed by a second communication that reveals more features of the underlying market transaction—in effect using a transaction's fingerprint to hide its footprint. Solving the information leakage problem greatly expands the potential applications of private distributed ledger technology to include trading.},

It was also accepted in 1998 as an ISO standard and is under consideration for inclusion in some other ISO standards. Unlike the ordinary discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem, no subexponential-time algorithm is known for the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. For this reason, the strength-per-key-bit is substantially greater in an algorithm that uses elliptic curves.

abstract = {In two experiments we evaluated different techniques for flight rehearsal to develop navigational knowledge about a region. In Experiment 1 different groups of pilots studied a map of a region, actively flew an IRIS simulator through the same region, or passively viewed the same dynamic screen as flown by the active participants. The latter two groups were subdivided into those that trained with high and low levels of scene detail. All pilots then transferred to a high-image-fidelity simulation to fly the same route. The transfer results indicated no effect of scene detail and that the active group performed best, the passive group worst, and the map group at an intermediate level. In Experiment 2 the workload of training was increased, and half the participants were required to train with a north-up map. These changes degraded the transfer performance of the active training group relative to the other two. The implications of the results for workload during rehearsal flights and the kinds of geographical knowledge acquired are discussed.},

Further, Wavelet Local Multiple Correlation for the given crypto-currency prices are estimated across different timescales. From the results, it is found that that the correlation follows an aperiodic cyclical nature, and the crypto-currency prices are driven by Bitcoin price movements. Based on the results obtained, we suggest that constructing a portfolio based on crypto-currencies may be risky at this point of time as the other crypto-currency prices are mainly driven by Bitcoin prices, and any shocks in the latter is immediately transformed to the former.},

This paper explores triple-entry accounting, from its conception to the current state of play, using three case studies. We find that: (i) in a blockchain ecosystem, for some accounts, business entities will only need to perform a single entry internally and the opposite entry will be recorded in a public shared ledger; and (ii) triple-entry accounting is a new and a more efficient way to address fundamental trust and transparency issues that plague current accounting systems. Triple-entry accounting with blockchain, when properly implemented, can fundamentally improve accounting.},

abstract = {This paper briefly reviews the distributed communication network concept in which each station is connected to all adjacent stations rather than to a few switching points, as in a centralized system. The payoff for a distributed configuration in terms of survivability in the cases of enemy attack directed against nodes, links or combinations of nodes and links is demonstrated. A comparison is made between diversity of assignment and perfect switching in distributed networks, and the feasibility of using low-cost unreliable communication links, even links so unreliable as to be unusable in present type networks, to form highly reliable networks is discussed. The requirements for a future all-digital data distributed network which provides common user service for a wide range of users having different requirements is considered. The use of a standard format message block permits building relatively simple switching mechanisms using an adaptive store-and-forward routing policy to handle all forms of digital data including digital voice. This network rapidly responds to changes in the network status. Recent history of measured network traffic is used to modify path selection. Simulation results are shown to indicate that highly efficient routing can be performed by local control without the necessity for any central, and therefore vulnerable, control point. ER -},

Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful diffusion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual diffusion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader diffusion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised.

We emphasise the timeliness of our contribution with an application to the two largest cryptocurrency markets: Bitcoin and Ripple. Results shed new light on emerging debates over the nature of cryptocurrency markets and competition between rival digital currencies.},

abstract = {Reliable computer systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting information to different parts of the system. This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are then discussed.},

abstract = {A bona fide currency functions as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account, but bitcoin largely fails to satisfy these criteria. Bitcoin has achieved only scant consumer transaction volume, with an average well below one daily transaction for the few merchants who accept it. Its volatility is greatly higher than the volatilities of widely used currencies, imposing large short-term risk upon users. Bitcoin's daily exchange rates exhibit virtually zero correlation with widely used currencies and with gold, making bitcoin useless for risk management and exceedingly difficult for its owners to hedge. Bitcoin prices of consumer goods require many decimal places with leading zeros, which is disconcerting to retail market participants. Bitcoin faces daily hacking and theft risks, lacks access to a banking system with deposit insurance, and is not used to denominate consumer credit or loan contracts. Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than a currency.},

abstract = {Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires an upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e. loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which have been exploited recently (February 2020). This paper is the first to explore the implication of flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We analyze two existing attacks vectors with significant ROIs (beyond 500k{\%}), and then go on to formulate finding flash loan-based attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain as well as the state of the DeFi ecosystem. Specifically, we show how two previously executed attacks can be "boosted" to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37x and 1.73x, respectively.},

abstract = {Distributed systems play a crucial role in modern infrastructure, but are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. This difficulty arises from two main challenges: (a) correctly implementing core system components (e.g., two-phase commit), so all their internal invariants hold, and (b) correctly composing standalone system components into functioning trustworthy applications (e.g., persistent storage built on top of a two-phase commit instance). Recent work has developed several approaches for addressing (a) by means of mechanically verifying implementations of core distributed components, but no methodology exists to address (b) by composing such verified components into larger verified applications. As a result, expensive verification efforts for key system components are not easily reusable, which hinders further verification efforts.

In this paper, we present Disel, the first framework for implementation and compositional verification of distributed systems and their clients, all within the mechanized, foundational context of the Coq proof assistant. In Disel, users implement distributed systems using a domain specific language shallowly embedded in Coq and providing both high-level programming constructs as well as low-level communication primitives. Components of composite systems are specified in Disel as protocols, which capture system-specific logic and disentangle system definitions from implementation details. By virtue of Disel's dependent type system, well-typed implementations always satisfy their protocols' invariants and never go wrong, allowing users to verify system implementations interactively using Disel's Hoare-style program logic, which extends state-of-the-art techniques for concurrency verification to the distributed setting. By virtue of the substitution principle and frame rule provided by Disel's logic, system components can be composed leading to modular, reusable verified distributed systems.

We describe Disel, illustrate its use with a series of examples, outline its logic and metatheory, and report on our experience using it as a framework for implementing, specifying, and verifying distributed systems.},

First, we match existing economic models to the disparate set of custodial systems. Next, we characterize the unique risks that emerge in non-custodial stablecoins and develop a model framework that unifies existing models from economics and computer science. We further discuss how this modeling framework is applicable to a wide array of cryptoeconomic systems, including cross-chain protocols, collateralized lending, and decentralized exchanges.

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

abstract = {A typical e-business transaction takes hours or days to complete, involves a number of partners, and comprises many failure points[8]. With short-lived transactions, database systems ensure atomicity by either committing all of the elements of the transaction, or by canceling all of them in case of a failure. With typical e-business transactions, strict atomicity is not practical, and we need a way of reversing the effects of those activities that cannot be rolled back: That is compensation. For a given business process, identifying the various failure points, and designing the appropriate compensation processes represents the bulk of process design effort[8]. Yet, business analysts have little or no guidance. For a given failure point, there appears to be an infinite variety of ways to compensate for it. We recognize that compensation is a business issue, but we argue that it can be explained in terms of a handful of parameters within the context of the REA ontology [19], including things such as the type of activity, the type of resource, and organizational policies. We propose a three-step compensation design approach that 1) starts by abstracting a business process to focus on those activities that create/modify value, 2) compensates for those activities, individually, based on values of the compensation parameters, and 3) composes those compensations using a Saga-like approach [10]. In this paper, we present our approach along with an implementation algorithm and propose a business ontology for compensation design. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Readiness describes the degree of transaction costs, time and uncertainty that must be borne in order to effect a transaction. Consider a portfolio held by a financial institution.

This may be the case, for example, if the firm needs to liquidate the portfolio to fund short term obligations coming due.

@article{Pirrong2012,
abstract = {All too often, legislative solutions to some financial crisis have serious consequences that are both unwanted and unintended. The author of this article foresees several possible negative consequences arising from Title VII of the Dodd‐Frank Act, which mandates that eligible derivatives be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) that require initial and variation margin. The new legislation also requires that the remaining non‐cleared derivatives that are traded by some market participants be more heavily collateralized. The Act's authors have argued that derivatives pose uniquely dangerous systemic risks because of the leverage and counterparty risk associated with them. Increased collateralization, their thinking goes, would reduce derivatives‐related leverage and the systemic risk to the financial system associated with such leverage. The author argues that these hopes are unduly optimistic because they fail to recognize how market participants can substitute other forms of leverage, such as bank lines of credit or collateral transformation trades, for the leverage derivatives provided previously. The author also believes that the larger collateral mandates and frequent marking‐to‐market will make the financial system more vulnerable since margin requirements tend to be “pro‐cyclical.” And more rigid collateralization mechanisms can restrict the supply of funding liquidity, and lead to spikes in funding liquidity demand that can reduce the liquidity of traded instruments and generate destabilizing feedback loops. The fragmentation of CCPs across jurisdictions and products will lead to greater demand for CCP‐eligible collateral to maintain the same level of hedging transactions. This demand will likely be met by using riskier assets as collateral and encourage the shadow banking system to create new assets that can be posted as collateral (for example, via collateral transformation services). In sum, although the Dodd‐Frank rules are intended to reduce systemic risk, their expected impact on liquidity makes it a very open question as to whether they will achieve this goal. Although they may reduce some risks, they will simply shift others while possibly creating new ones.},

The results show that bitcoin can clearly be used as a hedge against stocks in the Financial Times Stock Exchange Index. Additionally bitcoin can be used as a hedge against the American dollar in the short-term. Bitcoin thereby possess some of the same hedging abilities as gold and can be included in the variety of tools available to market analysts to hedge market specific risk.},

This study recommends laboratories undertake digital transformations to capitalize on the decentralization movement, develop a more comprehensive understanding of crime and security-relevant problems, and play a more central role in problem-solving collaboratively with law enforcement organizations and other stakeholders. A framework for the bilateral transfer of information and knowledge is proposed to magnify the impact of forensic science laboratories on abating crime, strengthening security, and reinforcing the criminal justice system. To accomplish digital transformations, laboratories require personnel with different expertise, including investigative reasoning, knowledge codification, data analytics, and forensic intelligence. Ultimately, this study encourages managers, educators, researchers, and policymakers to look beyond the usefulness of forensic results for solving individual investigations, and to realize the value of combined forensic knowledge and intelligence for developing broader strategies to deal with crime in digitalized society. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Academy of Forensic Sciences},

It does so by formalizing the activity as an all-pay contest: a competition where participants contend with each other to win a prize by investing in computational power, and victory is probabilistic. With at least two active miners, the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game suggests the following interesting insights on the motivation for being a miner: while the optimal amount of energy consumption depends also on the reward for solving the puzzle, as long as the reward is positive the decision to be an active miner depends only on the mining costs. Moreover, the intrinsic structure of the mining activity seems to prevent the formation of a monopoly, because in an equilibrium with two miners, both of them will have positive expected profits for any level of the opponent's costs. A monopoly could only form if the rate of return on investment were higher outside bitcoin.},

Yet little is really known about its meaning, legal implications and policy consequences. This paper introduces DeFi, puts DeFi in the context of the traditional financial economy, connects DeFi to Open Banking and ends with some policy considerations. We suggest that decentralization has the potential to undermine traditional forms of accountability and potentially erodes the effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement. At the same time, where parts of the financial services value chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration of a different (but possibly less regulated, less visible and less transparent) part of the value chain. DeFi regulation supervision could and should focus on this reconcentrated part to ensure effective oversight and risk control. Looking more broadly, decentralized finance offers the potential for an entirely new way to design regulation, building regulatory approaches into DeFi as a design feature, potentially decentralizing both finance and its regulation: the ultimate expression of RegTech.},

@incollection{Catania2018,
abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have recently gained a lot of interest from investors, central banks and governments worldwide. The lack of any form of political regu-lation and their market far from being " efficient " , require new forms of regulation in the near future. From an econometric viewpoint, the process underlying the evo-lution of the cryptocurrencies' volatility has been found to exhibit at the same time differences and similarities with other financial time–series, e.g. foreign exchanges returns. This short note focuses on predicting the conditional volatility of the four most traded cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. We investi-gate the effect of accounting for long memory in the volatility process as well as its asymmetric reaction to past values of the series to predict: one day, one and two weeks volatility levels. Many of the stylized facts that characterize usual financial time–series also apply to cryptocurrencies. For instance, similar to equity prices, cryptocurrencies exhibit: i) time–varying volatility, ii) extreme observations, and iii) an asymmetric reaction of the volatility process to the sign of past observations (i.e., leverage effect). However, standard dynamic volatility models like the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model of Bollerslev (1986) do not perform accurately and Catania and Grassi (2017) show that they are outperformed by more refined alternatives like the Score Driven model with conditional Generalized Hyperbolic Skew Student's t (GHSKT) innovations. The specification of the conditional distri-bution of the aforementioned Score Driven volatility model, GHSKT, is important since it characterises the filter for the conditional volatility, see Creal et al. (2013) and Harvey (2013). For instance, Catania and Grassi (2017) find that the robust volatility filter implied by the Score Driven–GHSKT model is of primary impor-tance in describing the stochastic evolution of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, in their analysis involving 289 cryptocurrencies, GARCH is never preferred according to likelihood criteria. The aim of this short note is to extend results of Catania and Grassi (2017) to the important tasks of predicting future volatility levels of the four most representative cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Those cryptocurrencies are the most important in terms of diffusion and market capitalization. At the time of writing market capitalization in USD dollars is 185.5 billion for Bitcoin, 44.3 billion dollars for Ethereum, 9.7 billion dollars for Ripple and 5.5 billion dollars for Litecoin. All together, these cryptocurrencies represent the 73{\%} of the total cryp-tocurrency market value. See Catania and Grassi (2017) for a detailed description of those cryptocurrencies. Since volatility is unobserved and realized volatility measures are not available, in our forecasting analysis we proxy future volatility levels with the square of the re-alized log–returns. Squared returns are known to be a poor volatility proxy, and poor volatility proxies are known to affect forecast comparison, see Andersen and Bollerslev (1998). To lower the influence of a volatility proxy on our results, model comparison is performed using the Quasi–Like (QLIKE) loss function which, as discussed by Patton (2011), is robust to this choice of volatility proxy. Specifically, let $\sigma$ j,t+h|t be the h–step ahead volatility prediction made by model j at time t, and let r t+h the log returns at time t + h, the QLIKE loss is defined as: QLIKE($\sigma$},

This observation not only applies to conventional political constitutions, but to the fundamental rules which govern interactions by numerous people using new forms of technology. Blockchain technology aims to coordinate action in a world of incomplete information and opportunism, but the governance arrangements in blockchain protocols remain far from settled. Drawing upon recent theoretical developments regarding constitutional change, we interpret changes to the fundamental working rules of blockchain protocols as central to the adaptive, emergent nature of activity within this technological space. We apply this concept of "constitutional catallaxy" to selected blockchain platform case studies, illustrating the dynamism inherent in establishing protocols within the blockchain. Blockchain coordination changes and adapts not only to the technological limitations of the available protocols, but to mutual expectations and influence of interacting stakeholders.},

abstract = {We rely on economic theory to discuss how blockchain technology will shape the rate and direction of innovation. We identify two key costs affected by the technology: 1) the cost of verification; and 2) the cost of networking. The first cost relates to the ability to cheaply verify the attributes of a transaction. The second one to the ability to bootstrap and operate a marketplace without the need for a traditional intermediary: When combined with a native token (as in Bitcoin and Ethereum), a blockchain allows a decentralized network of economic agents to agree, at regular intervals, about the true state of shared data. This shared data can represent exchanges of currency, intellectual property, equity, information or other types of contracts and digital assets - making blockchain a general purpose technology that can be used to trade scarce, digital property rights and create novel types of digital platforms. The resulting marketplaces are characterized by increased competition, lower barriers to entry and innovation, lower privacy and censorship risk, and allow participants within the same ecosystem to make investments to support and operate shared infrastructure without assigning market power to a platform operator. They also challenge the existing revenue models and accumulated knowledge and resources of incumbents, and open opportunities for new approaches to startup fundraising, the provision of public goods and software protocols, data ownership and licensing, auctions and reputation systems.},

Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on blockchain technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised exploded in 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, the blockchain sector is in its early stages, and little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. In this initial study, I therefore assess ICO's success factors by empirically exploring the capital raised in 238 ICOs in 2016 and 2017. The results show that several characteristics of the ICO campaign and the underlying technology determine the amount raised, while the venture characteristics are less important to investors. While some dynamics resemble those in the context of venture capital or crowdfunding, others are unique to the context of blockchain technology and have not been assessed before. Further analyses explore the duration of ICO campaigns as well as the language used in documents accompanying the ICO. The findings have important implications for theory and practice. For example, they inform policy makers about potential starting points for the introduction of ICO regulation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper investigates the information transmission between the most important cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. We use a VAR modelling approach, upon which the Geweke's feedback measures and generalized impulse response functions are computed. This methodology allows us to fully characterize the direction, intensity and persistence of information flows between cryptocurrencies. At this data granularity, most of information transmission is contemporaneous. However, it seems that there are some lagged feedback effects, mainly from other cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin. The generalized impulse-response functions confirm that there is a strong contemporaneous correlation and that there is not much evidence of lagged effects. The exception appears to be related to the overreaction of Bitcoin returns to contemporaneous shocks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Among all analyzed BitCoin features, the extreme price volatility stands out most clearly compared to standard currencies. In order to understand the reasons for such extreme price volatility, we attempt to identify drivers of BitCoin price formation and estimate their importance econometrically. We apply time-series analytical mechanisms to daily data for the 2009–2014 period. Our estimation results suggest that BitCoin attractiveness indicators are the strongest drivers of BitCoin price followed by market forces. In contrast, macro-financial developments do not determine BitCoin price in the long-run. Our findings suggest that as long as BitCoin price will be mainly driven by speculative investments, BitCoin will not be able to compete with standard currencies.},

abstract = {The surge in the number of initial coin o¤erings (ICOs) in recent years has led to both excitement about cryptocurrencies as a new funding model for innovations in the digital age, and to anxiety about a potential bubble. This paper develops a model to address several basic questions: What determines the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency? How would market trading interact with its fundamentals in an uncertain and opaque environment? In our model, a cryp-tocurrency constitutes membership in a platform developed to facilitate transactions of certain goods or services. The complementarity in the households' participation in the platform acts as an endogenous, yet fragile, fundamental of the cryptocurrency. There exist either two or no equilibria, and the two equilib-ria, when they exist, have disparate properties. When the transaction demand for the platform is unobservable, the trading price and volume of the cryptocurrency serve as important channels for not only aggregating private information about its fundamental, but also facilitating coordination on a certain equilibrium.

Finally, we find a strong positive association between the Baltic dry index and long-term Bitcoin volatility. This result shows that Bitcoin volatility is closely linked to global economic activity.

We use the largest available dataset to date, consisting of 1,009 ICOs from 2015 to March 2018. Our data highlights that venture uncertainty (not being on Github and Telegram, shorter whitepapers, higher percentage of tokens distributed) is negatively correlated, while higher venture quality (better connected CEOs and larger team size) is positively correlated, with ICO success. Moreover, providing a hard cap in a pre-ICO can help investors measure success in the pre-sale. This is another positive signal of funding success.},

abstract = {The Ripple credit network has emerged as a payment backbone with key advantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and altcoins), and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond. This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the IOU credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the core of the network and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112, 000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid-July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their IOU credit links.},

Without "physical delivery," strategies based on "corners" or "squeezes" are infeasible. However, uninformed investors still earn positive expected profits by establishing a futures position and then trading in the spot market to manipulate the spot price used to compute the cash settlement at delivery. We also show that as the number of manipulators grows, profits from manipulation fall to zero. However, even in the limit, manipulation still has a nontrivial impact on market liquidity. More broadly, we interpret manipulation as a form of endogenous "noise trading" which can arise in multiperiod security markets.},

abstract = {The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by the accumulation of excessive financial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem with a 76{\%} market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol, focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized within 19 days.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are full-fledged programs that run on blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains). In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5{\%}, 90.1{\%} and 80{\%} contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.},

abstract = {Markets face a new and daunting mode of manipulation. With this new mode of market manipulation, millions of dollars can vanish in seconds, rogue actors can halt the trading of billion-dollar companies, and trillion-dollar financial markets can be distorted with a simple click or a few lines of code. Every investor and institution is at risk. This is the new precarious reality of our financial markets. This Article is about our ominous financial reality, this dangerous new mode of market manipulation, and the need for pragmatic policies to better address the rising threats to manipulate our financial markets. To start, the Article offers an overview about the recent rise and regulation of new financial technology. It begins with a close examination of The Flash Crash of 2010 and the publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis. Next, the Article surveys the changing landscape of market manipulation. It identifies traditional manipulation methods like cornering, front running, and pumping-and-dumping, as well as new manipulation methods like spoofing, pinging, and mass misinformation. It explains how new cybernetic market manipulation schemes that leverage modern technologies like electronic networks, social media, and artificial intelligence are more harmful than traditional schemes. The Article then grapples with why this new mode of market manipulation will present critical challenges for regulators. Finally, it recommends three pragmatic proposals for combating the new threats of cybernetic market manipulation by improving intermediary integrity, enhancing financial cybersecurity, and simplifying investment strategies. Ultimately, this Article provides an original and improved framework for thinking and acting anew about market regulation, market operations, and market manipulation.},

abstract = {Early analysis of Bitcoin concluded that it did not meet the economic conditions to be classified as a currency. Since this conclusion, interest in Bitcoin has increased substantially. We investigate whether the introduction of futures trading in Bitcoin is able to resolve the issues that stopped Bitcoin from being considered a currency. Our analysis shows that spot volatility has increased following the appearance of futures contracts, that futures contracts are not an effective hedging instrument, and that price discovery is driven by uninformed investors in the spot market. We therefore argue that the conclusion that Bitcoin is a speculative asset rather than a currency is not altered by the introduction of futures trading.},

abstract = {The increasing use of digital documents, and the need to refer to them conveniently and unambiguously, raise an important question: can one "name" a digital document in a way that conveniently enables users to find it, and at the same time enables a user in possession of a document to be sure that it is indeed the one that is referred to by the name? One crucial piece of a complete solution to this problem would be a method that provides a cryptographically verifiable label for any bit-string (for example, the content, in a particular format, of the document). This problem has become even more acute with the emergence of the WorldWide Web, where a document (whose only existence may be on-line) is now typically named by giving its URL, which is merely a pointer to its virtual location at a particular moment in time. Using a one-way hash function to call files by their hash values is cryptographically verifiable, but the resulting names are unwieldy, because of their length and randomness, and are not permanent, since as time goes on the hash function may become vulnerable to attack. We introduce procedures to create names that are short and meaningful, while at the same time they can persist indefinitely, independent of the longevity of any given hash function. This is done by namung a bit-string according to its position in a growing, directed acyclic graph of one-way hash values. We prove the security of our naming procedures under a reasonable complexity-theoretic cryptographic assumption, and then describe practical uses for these names. An implementation of our naming scheme has been in use since January 1995.},

According to this research, good policy rules typically call for changes in the federal funds rate in response to changes in the price level or changes in real income. An objective of the paper is to preserve the concept of such a policy rule in a policy environment where it is practically impossible to follow mechanically any particular algebraic formula that describes the policy rule. The discussion centers around a hypothetical but representative policy rule much like that advocated in recent research. This rule closely approximates Federal Reserve policy during the past several years. Two case studies-German unification and the 1990 oil-price shock-that had a bearing on the operation of monetary policy in recent years are used to illustrate how such a policy rule might work in practice. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {We investigate triangular arbitrage within the spot foreign exchange market using high-frequency executable prices. We show that triangular arbitrage opportunities do exist, but that most have short durations and small magnitudes. We find intra-day variations in the number and length of arbitrage opportunities, with larger numbers of opportunities with shorter mean durations occurring during more liquid hours. We demonstrate further that the number of arbitrage opportunities has decreased in recent years, implying a corresponding increase in pricing efficiency. Using trading simulations, we show that a trader would need to beat other market participants to an unfeasibly large proportion of arbitrage prices to profit from triangular arbitrage over a prolonged period of time. Our results suggest that the foreign exchange market is internally self-consistent and provide a limited verification of market efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Through either mechanism, an ICO increases platform value, makes the launch of a valuable platform more likely, and thus increases social welfare. We use our model to provide guidance to regulators: We analyze under what circumstances ICOs should be banned or allowed, and discuss governance mechanisms that they should include.},

TumbleBit allows parties to make fast, anonymous, off-blockchain payments through an untrusted intermediary called the Tumbler. TumbleBits anonymity properties are similar to classic Chaumian eCash: no one, not even the Tumbler, can link a payment from its payer to its payee. Every payment made via TumbleBit is backed by bitcoins, and comes with a guarantee that Tumbler can neither violate anonymity, nor steal bitcoins, nor print money by issuing payments to itself. We prove the security of TumbleBit using the real/ideal world paradigm and the random oracle model. Security follows from the standard RSA assumption and ECDSA unforgeability. We implement TumbleBit, mix payments from 800 users and show that TumbleBits offblockchain payments can complete in seconds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Ensemble predictors such as the random forest are known to have superior accuracy but their black-box predictions are difficult to interpret. In contrast, a generalized linear model (GLM) is very interpretable especially when forward feature selection is used to construct the model. However, forward feature selection tends to overfit the data and leads to low predictive accuracy. Therefore, it remains an important research goal to combine the advantages of ensemble predictors (high accuracy) with the advantages of forward regression modeling (interpretability). To address this goal several articles have explored GLM based ensemble predictors. Since limited evaluations suggested that these ensemble predictors were less accurate than alternative predictors, they have found little attention in the literature. RESULTS Comprehensive evaluations involving hundreds of genomic data sets, the UCI machine learning benchmark data, and simulations are used to give GLM based ensemble predictors a new and careful look. A novel bootstrap aggregated (bagged) GLM predictor that incorporates several elements of randomness and instability (random subspace method, optional interaction terms, forward variable selection) often outperforms a host of alternative prediction methods including random forests and penalized regression models (ridge regression, elastic net, lasso). This random generalized linear model (RGLM) predictor provides variable importance measures that can be used to define a "thinned" ensemble predictor (involving few features) that retains excellent predictive accuracy. CONCLUSION RGLM is a state of the art predictor that shares the advantages of a random forest (excellent predictive accuracy, feature importance measures, out-of-bag estimates of accuracy) with those of a forward selected generalized linear model (interpretability). These methods are implemented in the freely available R software package randomGLM.},
