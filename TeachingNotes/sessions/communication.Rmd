## Oracle

Data feed services that provide smart contracts with external information / off-chain information. [@Klages-Mundt2020]

1. Centralized oracle
    * can be proven that the data feed is an authentic representation of a particular source
    * but it is still inherently manipulable by the source
1. Decentralized oracle: remain an open research question

1. Alice initiates the transaction by generating a secret (a key) that will be used to unlock the asset transfers later on. She then deploys a smart contract on Chain$_a$, that will lock her assets until time $t_a$.
    * This contract will transfer to Bob the assets only if the secret generated by Alice is revealed and entered in the smart contract.
    * After time $t_a$, should the secret have not been revealed, the smart contract expires and Alice's assets will be unlocked and returned to her wallet
1. Bob can verify the contract deployed by Alice on Chain$_a$ (assets, delivery address, etc.) and use the hash submitted by Alice in order to deploy a similar contract on Chain$_b$.
1. Alice can verify the contract deployed on Chain$_b$, unlock the assets, and initiate their transfer to her wallet by revealing the secret on Chain$_b$.
1. As early as when the secret is revealed in the mempool of Chain$_b$ (even before the Alice's transfer is confirmed), Bob can use the secret to unlock the assets on Chain$_a$ and complete the cross-ledger transaction.
