## Recap {.allowframebreaks}

### Why do we need blockchain?

### Problems native to distributed networks

![Bitcoin double spending](figure/doublespending)

---

### Digital signature


### Cryptographically secure hash function


# Bitcoin consensus algorithm (simplified)

## Proof-of-Work

1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. 
2. Each node collects new transactions into a block. 
3. In each round, a random node gets to broadcast its block. 
    - random: not selected, but through competition (**work**)
4. Other nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid (unspent, valid signatures).
5. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by including its hash in the next block they create.

### What do miners compete to solve?

---


***Hash puzzle***

$$H(nonce \| PrevHash \| tx1 \| tx2 \|) < target$$

### Benefit of using Merkle tree

Efficiency in data validation and storage: checking and downloading in branches

---


Solving hash puzzles is probabilistic, because nobody can predict which nonce is going to solve the hash puzzle.

*recall*: Sybil attack

---

51% Attack?

---

Attacker  has to subvert not only **the consensus process** (by having 51% computing power) but also the cryptography!

---

### Adjustable difficulty level

- Average block time: 10 min
- Target recalculated every 2,016 blocks -- every two weeks.

---


## Fork

![A blockchain fork](figure/fork.png){width=50%}

Miners diverge and start adding blocks to two chain branches


***Heuristic***

Follow the longest chain

---


## Incentives

### Block reward

![Total supply of bitcoins with time. The block reward is cut in half every 4 years, limiting the total supply of bitcoins to 21 million. This is a simplified model and the actual curve looks slightly different, but it has the same 21 million limit.](figure/bitcoinsupply.jpg){width=60%}


---

### Transaction fee

- The initiator of any transaction can choose to make the transaction output(s) $<$ input(s). 
- Whoever creates the block that first puts that transaction into the block chain gets to collect the difference, which acts a transaction fee.

---

## One stone two birds:

1. Encourage block building
2. Encourage honest behavior


## Coinbase transactions

First transaction of the block, paying the miner block reward + tx fees: [example](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000000044168724e53088f2753cd5d7f404cbc2fda0123e0c3167f94675?page=2)

**Caveat** Mining nodes may not be correctly configured to receive tx fee: [example](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/b6d51e8c6ed5744945c2ec53c0ac4485f6213a7936c892b9bc85272422c2f3c0)

## The economics of mining

$$MiningReward = \underbrace{BlockReward + TransactionFee}_{\text{Probablistic}}$$
$$MiningCost = \underbrace{HardwareCost}_{\text{FixedCost}} + \underbrace{OperatingCosts}_{\text{Variable Cost}}$$


If $MiningReward > MiningCost$, then the miner makes a profit.


### Complications

- Other miners' hash rate?
- Denominations: USD/Bitcoin?
- Honest/dishonest?


---

***Research question***

Is the default miner behavior a *Nash equilibrium*? That is, does it represent a stable situation in which no miner can realize a higher payoff by deviating from honest behavior? [@Narayanan2016a]



# Other consensus mechanisms

## Proof of stake (PoS)

- Randomized block selection based on size of stake
    - Nxt
- Delegated proof of stake
    - EOSIO: Users stake `EOS` tokens to their favored block producers (BPs, 21 in total) and can choose to remove their stake at any time.
    - Tezos (Liquid Proof of Stake): number of consensus participants---or ``delegates''---changes.


## XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (XRP LCP)

- Each user sets up its own unique node list of validators (UNL) that it will listen to during the consensus process. The validators determine which transactions are to
be added to the ledger.
