## Recap {.allowframebreaks}

### Why do we need blockchain?

### Problems native to distributed networks

---

![Bitcoin double spending](figure/doublespending)

---

### Digital signature


### Cryptographically secure hash function


# Bitcoin consensus algorithm (simplified)

## Proof-of-Work

1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. 
2. Each node collects new transactions into a block. 
3. In each round, a random node gets to broadcast its block. 
    - random: not selected, but through competition (**work**)
4. Other nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid (unspent, valid signatures).
5. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by including its hash in the next block they create.

### What do miners compete to solve?

---


***Hash puzzle***

$$H(nonce \| PrevHash \| tx1 \| tx2 \|) < target$$

---

### Benefit of using Merkle tree

Efficiency in data validation and storage: checking and downloading in branches

---


Solving hash puzzles is probabilistic, because nobody can predict which nonce is going to solve the hash puzzle.

*recall*: Sybil attack

---

51% Attack?

---

Attacker  has to subvert not only **the consensus process** (by having 51% computing power) but also the cryptography!

---

### Adjustable difficulty level

- Average block time: 10 min
- Target recalculated every 2,016 blocks -- every two weeks.

---


## Fork

![A blockchain fork](figure/fork.png){width=50%}

Miners diverge and start adding blocks to two chain branches


***Heuristic***

Follow the longest chain

---


## Incentives

### Block reward

![Total supply of bitcoins with time. The block reward is cut in half every 4 years, limiting the total supply of bitcoins to 21 million. This is a simplified model and the actual curve looks slightly different, but it has the same 21 million limit.](figure/bitcoinsupply.jpg){width=60%}


---

### Transaction fee

- The initiator of any transaction can choose to make the transaction output(s) $<$ input(s). 
- Whoever creates the block that first puts that transaction into the block chain gets to collect the difference, which acts a transaction fee.

---

## One stone two birds:

1. Encourage block building
2. Encourage honest behavior


## Coinbase transactions

First transaction of the block, paying the miner block reward + tx fees: [example](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/00000000000044168724e53088f2753cd5d7f404cbc2fda0123e0c3167f94675?page=2)

**Caveat** Mining nodes may not be correctly configured to receive tx fee: [example](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/b6d51e8c6ed5744945c2ec53c0ac4485f6213a7936c892b9bc85272422c2f3c0)

## The economics of mining

$$MiningReward = \underbrace{BlockReward + TransactionFee}_{\text{Probablistic}}$$
$$MiningCost = \underbrace{HardwareCost}_{\text{FixedCost}} + \underbrace{OperatingCosts}_{\text{Variable Cost}}$$


If $MiningReward > MiningCost$, then the miner makes a profit.


### Complications

- Other miners' hash rate?
- Denominations: USD/Bitcoin?
- Honest/dishonest?


---

***Research question***

Is the default miner behavior a *Nash equilibrium*? That is, does it represent a stable situation in which no miner can realize a higher payoff by deviating from honest behavior? [@Narayanan2016a]



# Other consensus mechanisms

## Proof of stake (PoS)

- Randomized block selection based on size of stake
    - Nxt
- Delegated proof of stake
    - EOSIO: Users stake `EOS` tokens to their favored block producers (BPs, 21 in total) and can choose to remove their stake at any time.
    - Tezos (Liquid Proof of Stake): number of consensus participants---or ``delegates''---changes.


## XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (XRP LCP)

- Each user sets up its own unique node list of validators (UNL) that it will listen to during the consensus process. The validators determine which transactions are to
be added to the ledger.


# Bitcoin vs. Ethereum

## Record-keeping model

### BTC

![[UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/549244)](figure/BTCblock){width=85%}

Privacy through change addresses

---

### ETH

![[Account/Balance Model](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=4000000)](figure/ETHblock){width=85%}

Simple, intuitive.


## Language

### BTC

Bitcoin scripting

- Simple, not Turing complete

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->

**2 + 3 == 6?**

```
2 3 OP_ADD 6 OP_EQUAL
```

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->


**Transaction to Bitcoin address (pay-to-pubkey-hash, P2PKH)**

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <371c...313> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

where

`<371c...313>`: pubKeyHash.

`OP_DUP`: Duplicates the top stack item.

`OP_HASH160`: The input is hashed twice.

`OP_EQUALVERIFY`: `OP_EQUAL` + `OP_VERIFY`


---

### ETH

Solidity

- Sophisticated, Turing complete

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->


**Deposit to own account**

```
function deposit() payable {
  deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
};
```

# Smart contracts on Ethereum [@Perez2019a]

## What can/can't Smart Contracts do?

### Can

* Perform pretty much any computation
* Persist data (e.g. balance of users)
* Transfer money to other addresses or contracts

### Can't

* Interact with anything outside of the blockchain
* Be scheduled to do something periodically


## Flow to use a Smart Contract

1. Write high-level code for the contract
2. Test the contract
3. Compile the contract into bytecode
4. Send a transaction to deploy the contract
5. Interact with the contract by sending transactions
   to the generated address


## How Smart Contracts are executed

We want to execute smart contract at address A

* User sends a transaction to address A
* Transaction is broadcast in the same way as other transactions
* Miner executes the smart contract at address A
* If execution succeeds, new state is computed
* When receiving the block containing the transaction,
  other nodes re-execute smart contract at address A


## A few issues

How do we make sure that

* Execution terminates
* Users do not use too much storage
* Execution on different machines always yields the same result


## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Bytecode ...

### Simple loop from 0 to 10 using EVM instructions

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
```

## ... will look something like {.shrink}

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store 0 at position 0 in memory
JUMPDEST      ; set a place to jump (PC = 6)
PUSH1 0x0a    ; push 10 on the stack
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD         ; load loop counter
PUSH1 0x01
ADD           ; increment loop counter
DUP1
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store updated loop counter
LT            ; check if loop counter is less than 10
PUSH1 0x06
JUMPI         ; jump to position 6 if true
```


## Metering

Ethereum uses the concept of *gas*

* Transactions have a base gas cost
* Each instruction costs a given amount of gas to execute
* Transactions have a gas budget to execute
* Blocks have a total gas budget

Gas has two main purposes

* Protect against DoS attacks
* Incentivize miners

## Gas computation {.shrink}

Back to the previous example

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
JUMPDEST      ; 1 gas
PUSH1 0x0a    ; 3 gas 
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas 
MLOAD         ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x01    ; 3 gas
ADD           ; 3 gas
DUP1          ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
LT            ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x06    ; 3 gas
JUMPI         ; 10 gas
```

Total 410 gas: 10 for first 4 instructions, then 40 x 10

## Gas computation: special cases {.shrink}

Some instructions, have special rules.
For example, `SSTORE` rules are:

* If allocate storage: 20,000
* If modify allocated storage: 5,000
* If free storage: -15,000


```x86asm
PUSH 0x01
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; allocate: 20,000 gas
PUSH 0x02
PUSH 0x00 
SSTORE    ; modify: 5,000 gas
PUSH 0x00
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; free: -15,000 gas
```

## Gas and incentives

Miners are rewarded proportionally
to the amount of gas each transaction consumes.

* Transaction senders set a *gas price*
  * Amount of money/gas that the sender is ready to pay
  * Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher gas price
* Miners receive gas used &times; gas price for each transaction in the mined block
  * If gas budget is not fully used, gas left is returned to sender
  * If execution fails, the gas used is not returned
