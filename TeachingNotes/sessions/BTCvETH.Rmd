## Recap

1. Bitcoin miners' inventive
2. Merkle tree
    
![A block on the Bitcoin blockchain hased in a merkle tree](figure/block.jpg){width=50%}

### Benefit of using Merkle tree

Efficiency in data validation and storage: checking and downloading in branches

---

3. Adjustable difficulty level
  - [Hash rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)
    - 1 TH/s is 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) hashes per second.
  - [Difficulty level](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty)
  

4. Proof-of-Stake and other consensus mechanisms

5. Forks
  - Soft forks (and hard forks?)



# Bitcoin vs. Ethereum

## Record-keeping model

### BTC

![[UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/549244)](figure/BTCblock){width=85%}

Privacy through change addresses

---

### ETH

![[Account/Balance Model](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=4000000)](figure/ETHblock){width=85%}

Simple, intuitive.

## Language

### BTC

Bitcoin scripting

- Simple, not Turing complete

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->

**2 + 3 == 6?**

```
2 3 OP_ADD 6 OP_EQUAL
```

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->


**Transaction to Bitcoin address (pay-to-pubkey-hash)**

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <371c...313> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

where

`<371c...313>`: pubKeyHash.

`OP_DUP`: Duplicates the top stack item.

`OP_HASH160`: The input is hashed twice.

`OP_EQUALVERIFY`: `OP_EQUAL` + `OP_VERIFY`


---

### ETH

Solidity

- Sophisticated, Turing complete

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->


**Deposit to own account**

```
function deposit() payable {
  deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
};
```

#### Future development of Ethereum

- EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)-1559
- ETH 2.0
    1. Proof of stake
    1. Sharding
- Layer 2 scaling
    1. State channels (similar to Bitcoin lightning network): no open participation, application specific
    1. Plasma: no waiting period to withdraw funds from layer 2, not suitable for smart contracts
    1. Side chains: invalid state transition attack --- invalid block on a side chain
    1. Rollups: increase data layer capacity
        - zk Rollups: fast but difficult for existing smart contracts to migrate
        - Optimistic rollup: EVM compatible but slower



# Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

## Company vs. DAO

**Company**

- Rules enforced top-down
- Difficulty to change the rules depends on the management team

**DAO**

- Rules hard coded, enforced digitally
- Technically difficult to change the rules once they are *deployed*

## The DAO

- Purpose: Crowd-funding
- Process
    - Investors pay ETH in exchange for DAO (representing voting rights)
    - Investors vote for projects and winning projects receive ETH from the DAO
- Vulnerability
    - Loophole: a smart contract retrieves ETH first and then update the balance
- Attack
    - retrieve ETH recursively before updating the balance
- Consequence
    - Hard fork: Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic
    - What happens: One processes the same amount of ETH and ETC at the time of the fork [@Pauls2016]


## Side note: EOS token migration

- EOS Token transfer on Ethereum blockchain freezes on 1 June 2018 22:59:59 UTC/GMT
- Register Ethereum mainnet address prior to the deadline: associate the public key of one's Ethereum wallet with the public key of his (native) EOS wallet [@Masnavi2018]

# Decentralized finance 

## Decentralized exchange (DEX) {.shrink}

### DEXs on Ethereum: Automated market makers (AMM)
- Actors
    1. Liquidity initiator / introducer
    1. Liquidity provider
    1. Exchange user
    1. Arbitrageurs
    1. Protocol foundation
- Assets
    1. Risk assets
    1. Base/native/accounting/quote assets
    1. Pool shares
    1. Governance token
- Conservation function
    1. Uniswap: $k = R_o \cdot R_i$
    1. Balancer: $k = R_o^{W_o} \cdot R_i^{W^i}$
    1. Bancor: $k = \frac{S_j \cdot P_j}{R_{\tt USD}}$

---

### DEXs on XRPL: Ledger gateway

- Orderbook structure
- User-defined trustline
- IOU issuance
- Transitive trustline (ripple effect)

## Stablecoin [@Klages-Mundt2020]

- Custodial
    * Reserve Fund: Libra
    * Fractional Reserve Fund: $\tt USDT$
    * Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) (?)
- Non-custodial
    * $\tt DAI$: Collateralized by $\tt ETH$
    
## Lending protocols on Ethereum

- Value locked: deposits, liquidity supply
    - Maker: 2.4 Billion USD
    - Compound: 1.5 Billion USD
    - Aave: 1.3 Billion USD
- IOU token: proof that the protocol owes you
    - Maker: $\tt DAI$
    - Compound: $\tt cToken$
    - Aave: $\tt aToken$
- Collateral
- Liquidation
- Interest rate
- Governance token
    - Maker: $\tt MKR$
    - Compound: $\tt COMP$
    - Aave: $\tt AAVE$
