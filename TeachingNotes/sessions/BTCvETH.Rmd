## Recap

1. Bitcoin miners' inventive
2. Merkle tree

### Benefit of using Merkle tree

Efficiency in data validation and storage: checking and downloading in branches

---

3. Adjustable difficulty level
  - [Hash rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)
    - 1 TH/s is 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) hashes per second.
  - [Difficulty level](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty)
  

4. Proof-of-Stake and other consensus mechanisms

5. Forks
  - Soft forks (and hard forks?)



# Bitcoin vs. Ethereum

## Record-keeping model

### BTC

![[UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/549244)](figure/BTCblock){width=85%}

Privacy through change addresses

---

### ETH

![[Account/Balance Model](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=4000000)](figure/ETHblock){width=85%}

Simple, intuitive.

## Language

### BTC

Bitcoin scripting

- Simple, not Turing complete

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->

**2 + 3 == 6?**

```
2 3 OP_ADD 6 OP_EQUAL
```

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->


**Transaction to Bitcoin address (pay-to-pubkey-hash)**

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <371c...313> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

where

`<371c...313>`: pubKeyHash.

`OP_DUP`: Duplicates the top stack item.

`OP_HASH160`: The input is hashed twice.

`OP_EQUALVERIFY`: `OP_EQUAL` + `OP_VERIFY`


---

### ETH

Solidity

- Sophisticated, Turing complete

&nbsp;
<!-- force linebreak -->


**Deposit to own account**

```
function deposit() payable {
  deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
};
```

#### Future development of Ethereum

- EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)-1559
- ETH 2.0
    1. Proof of stake
    1. Sharding
- Layer 2 scaling
    1. State channels (similar to Bitcoin lightning network): no open participation, application specific
    1. Plasma: no waiting period to withdraw funds from layer 2, not suitable for smart contracts
    1. Side chains: invalid state transition attack --- invalid block on a side chain
    1. Rollups: increase data layer capacity
        - zk Rollups: fast but difficult for existing smart contracts to migrate
        - Optimistic rollup: EVM compatible but slower



# Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

## Company vs. DAO

**Company**

- Rules enforced top-down
- Difficulty to change the rules depends on the management team

**DAO**

- Rules hard coded, enforced digitally
- Technically difficult to change the rules once they are *deployed*

## The DAO

- Purpose: Crowd-funding
- Process
    - Investors pay ETH in exchange for DAO (representing voting rights)
    - Investors vote for projects and winning projects receive ETH from the DAO
- Vulnerability
    - Loophole: a smart contract retrieves ETH first and then update the balance
- Attack
    - retrieve ETH recursively before updating the balance
- Consequence
    - Hard fork: Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic
    - What happens: One processes the same amount of ETH and ETC at the time of the fork [@Pauls2016]

## Side note: EOS token migration

- EOS Token transfer on Ethereum blockchain freezes on 1 June 2018 22:59:59 UTC/GMT
- Register Ethereum mainnet address prior to the deadline: associate the public key of one's Ethereum wallet with the public key of his (native) EOS wallet [@Masnavi2018]
